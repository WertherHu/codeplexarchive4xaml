Then the business object can be used in a preference window or whereever columns have to be managed.<br /><br />\n<h1>Objectives</h1>\r\nThe goal of this project is to answer two problems encountered with the out-of-the-box WPF GridView :\n<ul><li>The gridview object does not allow managing the columns in a business object. For example, it is quite impossible to select columns from a preference window or a contextual menu.</li>\n<li>The gridview object allow reordering of the columns, but does not provide a way to persist the order.</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/GridViewColumnCollec/f5f57d72-0103-416f-ac09-7bda8b02bfc6\" alt=\"goal\" title=\"goal\" /><br />\n<h1>Current release</h1>\rThe current release (<a href=\"https://gridviewcolumncollec.codeplex.com/releases/view/25223\">Alpha 0.1</a>) answer to this problem, but some problem persist :\n<ul><li>the current implementation is dependent to a custom business object (actually based on the MVVM pattern).</li>\n<li>the current implementation is cleaning up references and event handlers, but there&#39;s probably some memory leaks. Implementing the weakevent and weakreference pattern is probably a good idea.</li></ul>\n\n<h1>Remarks:</h1>\rA part of the code is an adaptation of the code found here:  <a href=\"https://gridviewcolumncollec.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=http%3a%2f%2fmsdn.microsoft.com%2fen-us%2fmagazine%2fdd419663.aspx&referringTitle=Home\">MSDN Magazine &#58; WPF Apps With The Model-View-ViewModel Design Pattern</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
