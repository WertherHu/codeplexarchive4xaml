This app will store all the ingredients, recipes and menus for you.  <br />\n<h2>Basic Project Idea</h2>\r\nI started this project to teach myself WPF, I&#39;ve developed in C# for a number of years using Win Forms and some ASP.NET but not really touching the WPF side, so I decided it was about time. Since I needed some project to work on as just playing around with this and that never really teaches you how all the components mesh together I decided to write an app I would actually use and since I love cooking I decided to write an application that would store recipes and help me make up menus... So thats were the project came from.<br />\n<h2>Updates</h2>\r\n10/05 - Replaced some User Controls with Custom Controls - just to keep it tidy (and maybe make it easier to theme later)<br />10/03 - Moved custom controls and classes into their own seperate projects this should make it easier to maintain (also making the main project less cluttered)!<br />10/02 - No longer using Windows.Forms.MessageBox for information - change it so that the entire application gets drawn over so you cant miss it (thinking i might make this a control so i can determine buttons , text, icons etc)<br />\n<h2>Screenshots</h2>\r\n1 - Viewing Ingredient (with Image)<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/myrecipebook/9fd6ea95-be84-4a46-8c61-2a83136c4193\" alt=\"Ingredient_View_1.PNG\" title=\"Ingredient_View_1.PNG\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
