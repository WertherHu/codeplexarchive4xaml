Since it lies in the system tray it&#39;s very fast to take a screenshot whenever you want.<br />\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\rThe overlay color and opacity are fully configurable, it is also possible to define the destination directory so that Snap will automatically place a screenshot there without having to ask you where to put it. Taking it further you can define your public Dropbox folder and UserID and let Snap copy a public link of your recently created screenshot to the clipboard. Even recently the functionality to encode the public Dropbox link into a QRCode has been added, which allows you to get that link onto your smartphone. All this makes it easy to publish a screenshot to somebody with few clicks only.<br />Head over to the <a href=\"https://snap.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Getting%20Started&referringTitle=Home\">Getting Started</a> page for detailed information on how to setup and use Snap.<br />\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\rSnap is designed for Windows and requires <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6&amp;displaylang=en\">.NET 3.5</a> or later to run.<br />\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\rAll external assemblies are included in the setup or in a &quot;Prerequisites&quot; folder within the source.<br />I will upload the source of my own common libraries if needed.\n<ul><li>Common.dll (Common Library by myself)</li>\n<li>Common.WPF.dll (Common WPF Library by myself)</li>\n<li>Hardcodet.Wpf.TaskbarNotification.dll (<a href=\"#thirdparty\">Third Party Components</a>)</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Third Party Components <a name=\"thirdparty\"></a></h2>\rThanks to <a href=\"http://hardcodet.net\">Philipp Sumi</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/wpf_notifyicon.aspx\">WPF NotifyIcon DLL</a> licensed under the CPOL.<br />Thanks to <a href=\"http://ya-design.co.uk/\">Yacoo</a> for the icon again. </div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
