  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\"><b>Layered Architecture Sample</b> is designed to showcase various .NET Technologies such as Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Form, ASP.NET and ADO.NET Entity Framework working in conjunction with the <b>Layered Architecture Pattern</b>. It is aimed at illustrating how code of similar responsibilities can be factored into multiple logical layers which are applicable in most of today&#39;s enterprise applications.<br /><br />It is often that samples feature each .NET Technology independently to promote ease of learning but most developers are challenged when they need to apply all of the technologies that they have learned into a complete functional enterprise application. This is the problem area that Layered Architecture Sample attempts to address.<br /><br />Take note that the main objective of the sample is to focus on layering and therefore, you may discover that certain cross-cutting functionalities have been omitted to maintain its simplicity.<br /><br /><b><a href=\"https://layersample.codeplex.com/releases/view/117278\">Leave Sample January 2014 Release for .NET 4.5.1 - April 2014 Update</a> is now available</b>\n<ul><li>Demonstrates ASP.NET Web Forms Model Binding, WCF, WF and Enterprise Library DAAB 6.0</li>\n<li>Demonstrates ASP.NET Web Forms Model Binding, WCF, WF and Entity Framework 6.0 </li>\n<li>Demonstrates ASP.NET WebPages 3, ASP.NET WEB API 2, WF and Entity Framework 6.0</li>\n<li>Demonstrates ASP.NET MVC 5, WCF, WF and Entity Framework 6.0</li>\n<li>Demonstrates ASP.NET MVC 5, ASP.NET WEB API 2, WF and Entity Framework 6.0</li>\n<li>Demonstrates ASP.NET MVC 5, ASP.NET SignalR, ASP.NET WEB API 2, WF and Entity Framework 6.0 <b>(new)</b></li>\n<li>Demonstrates Windows Forms, WCF, WF and Entity Framework 6.0 </li>\n<li>Demonstrates WPF, MVVM, WCF, WF and Entity Framework 6.0 </li></ul>\n<br /><b><a href=\"https://layersample.codeplex.com/releases/view/107797\">Leave Sample July 2013 Release for .NET 4.5</a></b>\n<ul><li>Demonstrates Windows Forms, WCF, WF and Entity Framework 5.0 </li>\n<li>Demonstrates ASP.NET MVC 4, WCF, WF and Entity Framework 5.0</li>\n<li>Demonstrates ASP.NET Web Forms Model Binding, WCF, WF and Entity Framework 5.0 </li>\n<li>Demonstrates ASP.NET Web Forms Model Binding, WCF, WF and Enterprise Library DAAB 6.0</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/LayerSample/a42aced4-e7da-4c91-8ef9-4eef4424cef8\" alt=\"layered.jpg\" title=\"layered.jpg\" /><br /><br />If you are developing for the cloud, you may also want to check out <b><a href=\"http://cloudsample.codeplex.com\">Layered Architecture Sample for Azure</a></b><br /><br />You can now get started with creating the project structure that is illustrated in the sample with  <b><a href=\"http://layerguidance.codeplex.com\">Layered Architecture Solution Guidance</a></b>.
