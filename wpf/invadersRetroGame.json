Parts of the coding go to the authors of the book. I&#39;ve done some work adding extra functionality like a Mothership who increases Player Life, I tried to add Kamikaze, but didn&#39;t entirely succedd (working on it). The game was originally designed for Windows Store App, which is slightly different than WPF. Added sounds to player and invader shots and ship blasting sounds to both player and invader. Feel free to ask questions and/or provide input. Use Arrow keys Left and Right to move the Player, and Space Bar to shot the invaders.<br /><br />Have used Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 Version 14.0.25431.01 Update 3 Microsoft .NET Framework Version 4.6.01586</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
