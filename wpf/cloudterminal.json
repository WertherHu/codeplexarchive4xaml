Releases are made <a href=\"https://cloudterminal.codeplex.com/documentation?referringTitle=Home\">at specific milestones</a>, and when the <a href=\"http://cloudconnect.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets\">code appears to be stable</a>. Note that the program does <b>not</b> attempt to perform any <i>write</i> operations to any cloud service. Nevertheless, it is recommended to use credentials which have read-only access (such as those created by <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS IAM</a>) as they are stored in your user-profile in plain-text.<br />\n<h2>Install</h2>\r<a href=\"http://cloudconnect.codeplex.com/releases/clickOnce\">The project is released as a click-once install.</a><br />\n<h2>Plans / Releases</h2>\r<a href=\"https://cloudterminal.codeplex.com/documentation?referringTitle=Home\">View information about project organisation and plans for each release...</a><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
