It is in no way a system that can be used as a definitive means of gathering information although in the future it will be more reliable as it goes through its development iterations.<br /><br />The basis on which the project is currently being developed is a study called Stylometry which is the practice of attempting to quantify an authors writing style so that it may be analysed on a statistical basis. While this practice is still highly disputed their have been a large number of cases where it has succeeded. Given that, it is not clear if the system will work in successfully identifying if a document has been authored by multiple people.<br /><br />More details on stylometry and its application in this project will be added later.<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
