The library handles how to retrieve and save tag information, so it is completely transparent to the user. <br />This project also includes a WPF and console application built upon the library to allows user to view and edit image tags.<br /><br />Currently JPEG and PNG are supported.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
