If your environment is different, update those settings accordingly, or the solution won&#39;t build. We recommend running the project from within Visual Studio 2008 Professional, since SPOS uses SQL Express by default.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a screenshot:<br /><img src=\"/projects/BioApprovalWorkflow/9cc7d4d5-0849-472a-b3b1-02db64c2f4f6\" alt=\"SPOS-Screenshot.jpg\" title=\"SPOS-Screenshot.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
