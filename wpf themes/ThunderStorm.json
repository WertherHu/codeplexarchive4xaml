ThunderStorm does all the basic browser operations like browsing multiple sites using tabs, adding bookmarks, navigating back and forth between sites using the browser history.</p>\r\n<p>This browser was built as a fun little project and in my spare time. It's time to open it up to people and see what they think and if there is any future for this project.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Requires .Net Framework 4.0 (should be automatically installed with this installation.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Future enhancements:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size:10pt\">using webkit.net instead of windows browser control,</span>\r\n</li><li><span style=\"font-size:10pt\">building a command tab (like a command prompt) where people can enter commands to do various operations in the browser without the use of a mouse. These operations may include scrolling, opening new tabs, closing existing tabs,\r\n bookmarking, downloading browser content etc.</span> </li></ol>\r\n<p>All ideas and help to improve this browser are welcome.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
