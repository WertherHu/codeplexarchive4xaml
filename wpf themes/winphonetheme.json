I really like this idea as I typically have my phone in Dark theme and switch to Light when in bright sunshine. Unfortunately not a lot of applications make use of these themes so I wanted to share\r\n the method I use to implement it. </p>\r\n<p>I owe the technique to a great post from <a href=\"http://www.identitymine.com/forward/2010/11/theming-tips-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/\">\r\nIdentityMine</a>, essentially you derive a new static resource type which loads the correct themed xaml *before* your page has started to load.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
