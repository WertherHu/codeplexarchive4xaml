The application was developed using primarily WPF and C&#35;, with some low-level data manipulation routines written in C&#43;&#43; for high-performance.<br /><br />FITS Explorer does not make use of existing open-source FITS libraries, instead a small kernel of high-performance C++ functions has been developed to allow the creation of thumbnails and full-size previews of FITS image data. Other common image formats, such as jpeg, tiff, png, etc., are also supported.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://rarcher.net/_images/FITSExplorerMd.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
