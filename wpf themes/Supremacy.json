The game is intended to be          a spiritual successor to &quot;Birth of the Federation&quot;, which was developed in the          late 1990s by now-defunct MicroProse.         <br> <br> The project is still in early development, though much of the basic framework is          in place. Currently, you can build ships, colonize systems, and build planetary          structures. Limited automatic ship combat is implemented, though this will          eventually be replaced by an 3D tactical combat system (likely built with XNA).          Multiplayer gameplay is working, though there is currently no way to conquer          systems or win the game.         <br> <br> I started this project in large part as a learning experience, and as such it          has become a sort of testbed for me to try out several new Microsoft .NET-based          technologies, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WPF </li>\n<li>WCF </li>\n<li>LINQ (in-memory and XLINQ) </li>\n<li>Parallel Extensions </li>\n<li>XNA (likely platform for future implementation of a 3D combat system) </li>\n<li>Dynamic Language Runtime </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next up for development is the diplomacy system and the AI.         <br> <br> <strong>REQUIRED: </strong>The Microsoft .NET Framework v4.0 is required to run         <em>Supremacy</em>.         <br> <br> <strong>NOTE: <em>Supremacy</em> utilizes an automatic update service</strong>;          future release downloads will be rare, and will only published when major          content changes take place. Interim updates are published frequently, and the          game will inform you when such an update is available; you may then choose to          automatically download and install the update (or wait until later).</p>\n<div style=\"position:relative;background-color:#7d255b;display:block;border:solid 1px #7d255b;margin:2em 0em 0em 0em;padding:0;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0;letter-spacing:-0.001em;width:540px;height:58px;z-index:0\"><img style=\"position:relative;top:10px;left:10px;z-index:-1;float:left\" src=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/rs/rs1/rs468x60_violet.gif\" alt=\"\"> <span style=\"margin:7px 0px 0px -118px;padding:0;font-size:12px;cursor:pointer;float:left;clear:none;z-index:10;background-image:none;border:0;color:#e9d5e1;font-family:trebuchet ms,arial,sans-serif;font-weight:normal\"> We code with</span><a style=\"position:relative;left:0;width:355px;margin:0;padding:18px 0 14px 0px;line-height:13px;font-size:13px;cursor:pointer;background-image:none;clear:none;float:left;border:none;display:inline;color:#e9d5e1;font-family:trebuchet ms,arial,sans-serif;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none\" title=\"Supremacy developers recommend ReSharper.
