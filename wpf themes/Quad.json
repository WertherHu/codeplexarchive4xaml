At this moment we are working in creating the image processing part as a DirectShow filter. This DirectShow filter is not yet upload on the tfs server. <br /><br />I did all the tests on a Radeon GPU , we don&#39;t know yet how the code is running on nVidia GPUs.  </div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
