This repository and the github repository are always in sync. Development is performed on a private git repository and pushed to both codeplex and github when the source is stable.<br />\n<h2>About the project</h2>\r\nMulti-User-Dungeons (or MUDs) are online multiplayer games that are text driven, and combine role-playing, hack and slash and social chatting into a computer game that can be played through a special client, or a web browser. Typical MUDs are layed out in the style of a book, where the user is immersed in a world through text. The player can move from room to room, and read a description of the room, interact with the objects and characters within a room, and participate in events that take place. Players can interact with each other as they will occupy the same world together, and usually play the game in a role playing manor.<br /><br />The MUD Designer Engine is being developed with C# and .NET 4.5 portable class libraries. The engine runtime will be cross-platform, running on Windows (Vista, 7 and 8) desktop, Windows RT, Windows Phone, Linux distro&#39;s, OS X, iOS and Android. The engine will support Game Management, Networking, Scripting, Custom Commands and dynamic MUD creation. <br /><br />The toolkit has a full featured editing environment being developed along side the runtime, and a stand-alone telnet server.<br /><br />For those wanting to try the current source code version of the engine, they can download and install Visual C# 2012, download the latest source code build, and compile it. Please note that I will not upload changes to the source unless it compiles without error, but it is not guaranteed that features will exist as new versions are uploaded. <br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
