However the styling for the MDI container had to be entered in to the MainWindow directly for now, however, i hope to clean it up as time goes on. Every other style (i.e for the MDIChildren\r\n and their controls) however can be changed dynamically as per the default WPF MDI Project.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"/projects/wpfmdimetro/c200c3b3-3a5a-43ae-a4fb-606c9573bd33\" alt=\"Demo App\" width=\"648\" height=\"363\"></p>\r\n<p>The project contains a demo app that demonstrates the functionality.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
