Renames files, sets title, and changes date properties.<br /><br />I started this project as a way to practice WPF data binding. Now I use it every time I import pictures from my camera. \n<ol><li>I import the pictures</li>\n<li>I delete bad pictures and post process good ones in WLPG</li>\n<li>I copy the pictures to PhotoAlbumWorkflow</li>\n<li>I bulk rename the pictures without more specific filenames in PAW</li>\n<li>I set the title to the file name in PAW</li>\n<li>If a timestamp is out of whack I set the time stamp (for instance on a collage).</li></ol>\n<br />The setting of the timestamps came about because someone that I help manage their pictures library had a camera whose year settings was set to five years in the future. While I can&#39;t get the exact timestamp that the picture should be, I can use the existing timestamps on the picture to set the out of whack ones to something reasonable.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
