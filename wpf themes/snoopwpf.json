Go to the download page on <a href=\"http://snoopwpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/87261\">\r\nCodePlex</a> to download and learn more about it. Most notably, with this release, Bailey Ling has added a PowerShell scripting tab.</p>\r\n<h2>Git</h2>\r\n<p>The Snoop repository has been converted to Git and is now being hosted in two public repositories (which will be kept in sync) &hellip; the one at CodePlex (<a href=\"http://snoopwpf.codeplex.com/\">http://snoopwpf.codeplex.com/</a>) and the one at GitHub\r\n (<a href=\"https://github.com/cplotts/snoopwpf\">https://github.com/cplotts/snoopwpf</a>). See the 2.7.1\r\n<a href=\"http://snoopwpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/73187\">release notes</a> for more info.</p>\r\n<h2>Documentation on How to Use Snoop</h2>\r\n<p>I am finally getting to business on the <a href=\"http://snoopwpf.codeplex.com/documentation\">\r\nDocumentation</a> area on CodePlex. It will be a work in progress for a bit. Please forgive the mess.</p>\r\n<p>Here are the links to the current Snoop Tips &amp; Tricks: <a href=\"http://www.cplotts.com/2011/02/10/snoop-tips-tricks-1-ctrl-shift-mouse-over/\">\r\n#1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cplotts.com/2011/02/14/snoop-tips-tricks-2-snooping-transient-visuals/\">\r\n#2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cplotts.com/2012/05/31/snoop-tips-tricks-3-the-crosshairs/\">\r\n#3</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Also, don&rsquo;t forget about the documentation on Pete Blois&rsquo; Snoop <a href=\"http://blois.us/Snoop\">\r\npage</a>. It is still useful &hellip; but hopefully will be less so once I finish my efforts.</p>\r\n<h2>Why Aren&rsquo;t My Apps Showing Up in the App Chooser?</h2>\r\n<p>One question that comes up all the time is the situation where the application you are trying to Snoop, isn't appearing in the application chooser (i.e. the&nbsp; combo box that lists the processes you can Snoop). This is more than likely a situation where\r\n the application you are trying to Snoop is running elevated (as Administrator). In order to Snoop these applications, you will also need to run Snoop elevated (as Administrator).</p>\r\n<h2>Silverlight Support</h2>\r\n<p>Snoop is not currently able to spy Silverlight applications (maybe some day). In the meantime, if you want to do that, I would point you to Koen Zwikstra's awesome utility,\r\n<a href=\"http://firstfloorsoftware.com/silverlightspy/\">Silverlight Spy</a>.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
