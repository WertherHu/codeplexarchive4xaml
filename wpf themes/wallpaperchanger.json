  "Description": "I used to watch National Geographic Photo of the day everyday. \r\nhttp://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day\r\n\r\nSo I thought it might be helpful for people like me if a software synchronise the wallpaper with national geographic photo of the day. It also archives photo of the day along with publication date and photo title.",
