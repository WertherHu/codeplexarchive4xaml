  "Description": "Niko Neko Pureya is a simple media player designed for people who watch a series of videos (anime, drama etc). Since my main concern was an easy to use media player, I created AniPlayer X in VB.NET and later on ported the code to Niko Neko Pureya in C# using Microsoft's WMP ActiveX Control. It's very simple to use and it looks moderately good. And hopes that you'll enjoy it as well ^_^",
