  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\">A ASP.NET based UserControl for easy entry of Currency / Money. This User Control is extended from ASP.NET 2.0 TextBox control. It works for any .Net versions above 2.0. After using the AJAX MaskedEditExtender with TextBox control, I have found users complaining about it being cumbersome so I went ahead and wrote this User Control. It uses the ASP.NET TextBox in conjunction with some javascript to achieve the results without having to add any Mask. <br /><br />Supported:<br />1. Free flow entry with a programmable limit to number of decimals. This limit is set using a property.<br />2. Formats the money value on tab-out. <br />3. Changes to entry mode on focus.<br /><br />Does not, at this point of time,:<br />1. Allow negative values<br />2. Currency signs.<br /><br />Update: 9/12/2010 - a new binary is available with some bug fixes.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
