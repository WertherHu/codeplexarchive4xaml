It consists of a C&#35; server side event handler and optional Check-In Policies in C&#35; and Java.<br /><br /><b>User experience</b><br />From either Visual Studio or Eclipse, using Team Explorer Everywhere, a developer can include one or more work item ids in the check-in comment during a TFS check-in:<br /><br />Visual Studio:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/embeddedworkitems/043fd092-216a-41d0-b5fe-87daff19b83b\" alt=\"CheckInCommentVS.gif\" title=\"CheckInCommentVS.gif\" /><br /><br />Team Explorer Everywhere/Eclipse:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/embeddedworkitems/be3f017a-7087-4da1-a903-e07079137f2e\" alt=\"CheckInCommentTEE.gif\" title=\"CheckInCommentTEE.gif\" /><br /><br />Multiple work items can be referenced, each within square brackets:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/embeddedworkitems/180f6b77-c0d2-49d4-8b89-66bb3306c0dc\" alt=\"MultipleCheckInCommentVS.gif\" title=\"MultipleCheckInCommentVS.gif\" /><br /><br />As a result the changeset will have the referenced work item(s) linked, with exactly the same effect as selecting work items in the pending changes view:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/embeddedworkitems/1a9d53ab-68ef-47ec-a92d-25659f6ccf6e\" alt=\"ChangeSetDetailsVS.gif\" title=\"ChangeSetDetailsVS.gif\" /><br /><br />This has been impletented using a server side Event Handler and therefore there is no need for a client machine installation or configuration, however the project also includes a Team Explorer Everywhere check-in policy and a Visual Studio check-in policy to validate that the check-in comments do contain work item ids, and that those work item ids are valid. This policy is called &quot;Work Item In Comments Policy&quot;:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/embeddedworkitems/7983b1f3-100a-47a3-a66a-8d15bada198f\" alt=\"CheckInPolicyVS.gif\" title=\"CheckInPolicyVS.gif\" /><br /><br />The check-in policies will not associate the work items with the changeset; the event handler is required to complete the link.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
