If you want have more information about the engine you can find a good explanation on &quot;Partial rendering control using JQuery&quot;(you can find it on my article section). Even if that control is an ASP.Net version the &quot;core&quot; concept is very close to the one showed here.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
