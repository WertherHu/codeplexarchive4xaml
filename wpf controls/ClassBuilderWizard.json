Each plug-in allows you to create code from different data sources. If you don&#39;t see a plug-in that fits your needs, you can also create your own.<br />Please see the <a href=\"https://classbuilderwizard.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Plug-ins&referringTitle=Home\">Plug-ins Page</a><br />\n<h2>How to Use the Generated Code</h2>\rThere have been several questions about how to use the code that the wizard generates. I have put together a couple sample projects as demonstrations.<br /><table><tr><th>Language</th><th>Sample Project Type</th><th>Download</th><th>Notes</th></tr>\n<tr><td>C#</td><td>Windows Form</td><td><a href=\"/projects/ClassBuilderWizard/04779313-a43e-415f-8da7-51697f71cc18\">CodeUse_Windows_CSharp.zip</a></td><td>-</td></tr>\n<tr><td>C#</td><td>Web Site</td><td><a href=\"/projects/ClassBuilderWizard/f97b839f-c0c3-4e40-8d75-ac40ff37f19d\">CodeUse_Web_CSharp.zip</a></td><td>-</td></tr>\n<tr><td>VB</td><td>Web Site</td><td><a href=\"/projects/ClassBuilderWizard/986e2e8c-ec1e-493a-a240-c7357be0c8bf\">CodeUse_Web_VB.zip</a></td><td>(Thanks <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/UserAccount/UserProfile.aspx?UserName=yousaid\">yousaid</a>) Updated 2008-04-21 to support updates properly</td></tr></table><br />\n<h2>Screenshots</h2>\rPlease see the <a href=\"https://classbuilderwizard.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Screenshots&referringTitle=Home\">Screenshots page</a>.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
