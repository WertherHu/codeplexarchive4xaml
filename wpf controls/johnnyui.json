You can either attach the pie values as objects at design time or implement at run time.<br /><br />The scene will give warnings about cleaning up leaked meshes this is only because I have the editor update in Unity every time you change something, and it generates a dynamic Mesh object. Afaik the warning can be safely ignored.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
