However, when building sites with many shared partial views and other well-factored view constructs, this scheme (especially the shared folder) quickly gets out of control and becomes a jumbled mess of many many files.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself hunting through your view folders trying to locate that particular .cshtml file, then you'll benefit from this project.",
