  "Description": "Office 2007 ribbon control, with Orb and graphic transitions.\r\nAfter searching for many days looking for an Office 2007-like ribbon bar, I finally gave up and decided to write my own.  It's in decent shape as-is.  But anyone interested in helping me to continue the devlopment??",

If others like the Ribbon look as much as I do, them I&#39;m sure others will be use of this as well. <br /><br />I&#39;ve created this as a drop-in UserControl in VB.Net, simply add this single usercontrol file to your project and you are ready to go.<br /><br />It still needs a bit of work to go...so if you add or improve on it, please share those changes with everyone.<br /><br />Some of the features so far:<br />-Add Tabs, Groups, Buttons, Button Menus<br />-Graphics on the buttons and menu items<br />-Fade effect on Groups and Buttons<br />-Now have the ability to clear the entire ribbon.  Useful when updating your ribbon.<br /><br />The Groups fade in/out just like Office 2007 (using alpha blending of two picture.images)</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
