This happens to be true for several devices from Global Caché, such as the iTach, the GC100 and so forth.\r\n\r\niTachtoolkit can also be used as a base for enabling control of any device that can be interfaced, either directly or through a network-attached device, such as a regular PC, a microcontroller or what have you.\r\n\r\nTypical scenarios include using a smartphone running iOS/Android/Windows device or personal computer to control:\r\n\r\n1) A musicplayer such as i.e. Spotify and/or Wimp on a PC\r\n2) Lighting fixtures (may require a radio link)\r\n3) Scheduling in- or outdoor lighting to go on/off at certain points in time\r\n4) Ceiling fans or heat pump inverters\r\n5) Remotly control heating or watering facilities in a summer residence\r\n6) Turn on/off a sauna before home arrival\r\n7) Open garage door and/or gates before home arrival\r\n8) Pool lighting\r\n9) Record and replay any of the commands resulting from the above \r\n\r\nThe smartphone runs an app, such as iRuleAtHome, TouchIR+, ControlFx or similar to present a \"remote control\"-like user interface.\r\n\r\nThe things iTachtoolkit lets you do is merely limitied by your imagination.
