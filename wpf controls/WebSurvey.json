My new web hosting provider is linux-based, so unfortunately, the Live Demo will not work, but the documentation about WebSurvey usage should still be pretty accurate:  <a href=\"http://www.stchur.com/controls/websurvey/websurvey.html\">http://www.stchur.com/controls/websurvey/websurvey.html</a><br />\n<h1>Update ( 12.13.2009)</h1>\rI&#39;ve FINALLY begun working on a new version of WebSurvey.  That&#39;s the good news.  The &quot;bad&quot; (in quotes, because depending on your view, it might not be bad at all) news is that it&#39;s a MAJOR departure from how the control has been developed in the past.<br /><br />I&#39;ve changed directions pretty drastically with the new version.  What&#39;s so different?<br />\n<h2>WebSurvey v.Gimme</h2>\r<ul><li>Primarily AJAX / Javascript driven</li>\n<li>ASP.NET no longer required</li>\n<li>JSON takes the place of XML</li>\n<li>Rendered HTML markup now completely in YOUR control!</li></ul>\n<br />The new version is called &quot;Websurvey v.Gimme&quot; because I&#39;m using the Gimme Javascript Library as the backing framework to power WebSurvey.  I&#39;m sure a change as drastic as this will garner a lot of questions and &quot;buts&quot; so let me give just a quick example of how it works (so far that it -- it&#39;s still in early development).<br /><br />- Step 1: in your HTML page, include the necessary files -<br />&lt;script type = &quot;text/javascript&quot; src = &quot;gimme.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;script type = &quot;text/javascript&quot; src = &quot;websurvey.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;link rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot; type = &quot;text/css&quot; href = &quot;websurvey.css&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />- Step 2: somewhere in the body of your HTML page, declare an element to be a &quot;webSurvey&quot; and specify a few config options with a JSON object -<br /><br />&lt;form class = &quot;webSurvey&quot;&gt;<br />   &lt;span class = &quot;config&quot;&gt;<br />   {<br />      surveyFile: &#39;mySurvey.json&#39;,<br />      redirectPage: &#39;surveyCompletedPage.html&#39;,<br />   }<br />   &lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br /><br />Believe it or not, that&#39;s it!  Gimme and the WebSurvey js file will work together to &quot;find&quot; all webSurveys within a page, dynamically load your survey.json file and build the proper markup to power your survey.<br /><br />The devil is in the details though, and the details are in the survey.json file.  The format isn&#39;t completely baked yet, so I&#39;m not going to provide examples for that just yet.  But stay tuned.<br /><br />Comments / suggestions welcome</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
