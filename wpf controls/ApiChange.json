If you have the pdbs for your binaries at hand you can directly jump from excel to the matching lines into your code!<br /><br />The following example shows how you can track the usage of all String.Index method calls inside the .NET Framework. From the excel output you can create pivot tables to get valuable insights how the code base is really structured (e.g. who is using what method how often).<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/ApiChange/116041db-0785-443c-b136-d7258b50a879\" alt=\"Example&#32;Output\" title=\"Example&#32;Output\" /><br /><br />See <a href=\"https://apichange.codeplex.com/documentation?referringTitle=Home\">Documentation</a> for more information how you can query your code base.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
