Applicaiton is built with WPF on .net 3.5 Framework.<br /><br /><b>Why do I need iCloud Portal?</b><br />iCloud OS is a Cloud Operating System, which provided a powerful desktop user interface. So it is better to set IE to Full Screen Mode (Disable the status bar and make the menu and toolbars auto hide) while working with iCloud. But IE full screen mode is not so friendly with other websites. So I create this application.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
