The wiring for the null modem cable should be as follows</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pin 1 - No Connection</p>\r\n<p>Pin 2 - Pin 3</p>\r\n<p>Pin 3 - Pin 2</p>\r\n<p>Pin 4 - No Connection</p>\r\n<p>Pin 5 - Pin 5</p>\r\n<p>Pin 6 - No Connection</p>\r\n<p>Pin 7 - No Connection</p>\r\n<p>Pin 8 - No Connection</p>\r\n<p>Pin 9 - No Connection</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is important that you do not use a &quot;Full&quot; Null Modem cable with all its pin connections made. This is because the ACOM2000A's RS232 port does not appear to be a real RS232 port and it utilises the other pins for ACOM's own purposes.\r\n These appear to be undocumented however there have been reports that useage of a &quot;Full&quot; Null modem cable can cause errors to appear on the RCU (With &quot;Microprocessor conflict&quot; being the most common) or could even cause damage to the computer's COM port due\r\n to excessive voltage on the other lines.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Please note that when using this method, you will not be able to power on the ACOM2000A using ACOM&nbsp;Director.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Method 2 - Through a remote power on adaptor</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">ACOM themselves provide a remote power on adaptor and there are a number of homebrew solutions available on the internet. All of these solutions essentially operate in the same manner, using the RTS &amp;&nbsp;DTR&nbsp;lines of\r\n the COM port to switch pin 5 of the RCU connector in order to turn on the amplifier.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You will typically need a &quot;Full&quot; Null Modem cable if you are using one of these devices, however some designs will have the cross over of Pin 2 &amp; Pin 3 built into the adaptor, in which case a regular RS232 cable will be required.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Further details of the project can be found on my website below</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><a title=\"M0YOM ACOM Director\" href=\"http://www.m0yom.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">M0YOM - ACOM Director</a></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
