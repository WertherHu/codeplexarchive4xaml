The globe can be interactively rotated and selectable geographical locations can be added. \n\nWhen a location is selected, it is automatically animated to the center with the earth axis pointing upwards.\n\nSilverglobe is based on a 3D engine using vectors, matrices and quaternions. To show off the capabilities of Silverglobe and to demonstrate its usage, it contains a little sample application that lets you explore upcoming .NET conferences around the globe.",
