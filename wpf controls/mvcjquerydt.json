I needed the control to very flexible/Dynamic so that it renders any number of columns.<br /><br />I want to thank JQuery DataTable developers (http://www.datatables.net/) for providing a very nice library.<br /><br />This code is compiled with the Microsoft Framework. NET 4.5 with MVC 4.0 with LINQ and I am using JQuery 2.1.1 and JQuery DataTables 1.10.1 ver (http://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.1/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js)<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
