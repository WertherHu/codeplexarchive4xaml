While it does almost everything we need, the one thing I wanted to see was a very quick dashboard like screen with some general Sprint summary information. The Sprint Burn down, PBI and SBI counts and hours, etc. Something I could keep on and running in the team room next to our Build Status screen... <br /><br />So I wrote one. <br /><br />This is a work in progress and is very tightly coupled to the SfTS. I am using this project as a tool to help me and my team manage our Sprints, as means to learn WPF, MVVM, and the TFS API (with a little SQL Server Reporting Services fun mixed in).<br />\n<h1>Dev/Tech Notes</h1>\rThis is a Model-View-View Model (MVVM) based WPF application.<br />This application consumes the TFS API.<br /><a href=\"https://sftsquickboard.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Links%20and%20resources%20that%20were%20critical%20in%20making%20this%20happen&referringTitle=Home\">Links and resources that were critical in making this happen</a><br /><br /><b>Special Note</b><br />To reemphasize the point, I, and this project, are not directly associated with <a href=\"http://Conchango\">http://www.conchango.com/</a> or the <a href=\"http://Scrum for Team System\">http://www.scrumforteamsystem.com/en/default.aspx</a> project. I&#39;m just a consumer of the template and trying to add a little value and give a little back...<br /><br /><b>Personal Note</b><br />This is my first WPF, MVVM and TFS API project so the code is pretty ugly.... Be kind...<br />\n<h1>Screenshots</h1>\rMain Form<br /><img src=\"/projects/SfTSQuickboard/59042d42-5360-4813-a214-93a8d982a29a\" alt=\"SfTSMainForm.PNG\" title=\"SfTSMainForm.PNG\" /><br /><br />Options Dialog<br /><img src=\"/projects/SfTSQuickboard/e5a88d9f-ed95-4109-bf7e-c5f925159ff0\" alt=\"SfTSOptionsDialog.PNG\" title=\"SfTSOptionsDialog.PNG\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
