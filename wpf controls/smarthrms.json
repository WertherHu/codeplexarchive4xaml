Design patterns and principles enable loosely coupled and highly cohesive code, which will improve your codeâ€™s readability, flexibility, and maintenance. Each layer addresses an enterprise ASP.NET application and shows how proven patterns, principles, and best practices can be leveraged to solve problems and improve the design of your code. <br /><br />What This Project Covers<br /><br />This project covers well-known patterns and best practices for developing enterprise-level ASP.NET<br />applications. The patterns used can be applied to any version of ASP.NET from 1.0 to 4.0. The patterns<br />themselves are language agnostic and can be applied to any object oriented programming language such as Java my second favorite language.<br /><br />Some screen shots of SmartHRMS.<br />Home<br /><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Mdqlf9fbFqU/TvpNE0XIalI/AAAAAAAAACA/-wWSizY5TAc/w456-h257-k/Home.png\" /><br />Company Profile<br /><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TtgH9QSapp0/TvpNEyYB_tI/AAAAAAAAACQ/E-RxJm2pGLI/w616-h346-k/CompanyProfile.png\" /><br />System Administration<br /><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5MXeMac2FYw/TvpNFjhL6xI/AAAAAAAAACU/lqjIo6bD03E/w456-h257-k/SystemAdministration.png\" /><br />Users<br /><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2uk9tMYCbFM/TvpNFnqhkCI/AAAAAAAAACg/bUq6C4y6BTo/w456-h257-k/UserFilter.png\" /><br />UserProfile<br /><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mYIxUMk1xHw/TvpNGI48eJI/AAAAAAAAACk/k7fcgSoJTOo/w500-h281-k/UserProfile.png\" /><br />RoleProfile<br /><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1Fi6jJ5opUc/TvpNE3nYZGI/AAAAAAAAACE/cwny9cboTFE/w456-h257-k/RoleProfile.png\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
