This allows the user to go navigate in the presentation using voice commands &quot;Forward&quot;, &quot;Back&quot;, etc. This is a small sample of how the Kinect can be used for non-gaming\r\n projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Requirements</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Kinect for Windows SDK beta </li><li>Microsoft PowerPoint </li></ul>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>Usage</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Compile and run the project. This will launch PowerPoint. </li><li>Start a slide show. From here the voice commands &quot;Forward&quot; and &quot;Next Slide&quot; will take you to the next slide in the slideshow (or step you thru an series of animations) and the commands &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Previous Slide&quot; will take you back one.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>Limitations</strong><br>\r\nCurrently the plugin is setup to always connect to the Kinect. No error handling is in place to handling the hardware not being connected. This will be added later.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
