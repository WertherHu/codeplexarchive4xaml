Instead each child is drawn using the default renderers and its space and status are managed by the parent. Currently there are the following controls:\n<ul><li>RadioButtonList (similar the ASP.NET control)</li>\n<li>CheckBoxList</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/groupcontrols/f6dfce62-a94e-418a-ad06-b68b133d9897\" alt=\"GroupControls.jpg\" title=\"GroupControls.jpg\" /><br /><br />In the Source Code, you will find an example project. Of note along with the controls are two generic classes. The first is a clone of List&lt;T&gt; called EventedList&lt;T&gt;. It has all the same methods, but adds events on all changes to the list or its items. The second is a SparseArray&lt;T&gt; that behaves the same as a List&lt;T&gt;, but is built on top of a Dictionary&lt;T&gt; so that you can address items that have not been added and have non-sequential indexes. Both classes can be found in the source code.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
