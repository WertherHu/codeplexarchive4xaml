With a single sign on logic, you can define the applications you want to use this login and password. You can lock an application and throw\r\n errors when an application is not present on your database. </li><li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Uncluttered Roles management with managers</strong></span>: every role now has managers. You can define someone who manage the role without specifing a role or giving administrator privileges.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>In order to manage all the features of this provider, ADISSO comes from 2 extra tool:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Authorization module</strong></span>: in order to manage roles and managers, ADISSO includes a custom Authorization Module which specifies a web.config structure to protect your .net files and folders.\r\n</li><li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Custom Login View control</strong></span>: this control mimic the original asp:LoginView to manage all the features that come with ADISSO.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">*** PLEASE BE CAREFUL ***</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>As of January 23, 2012 the project is at its very first release.

Please ask me if you're interested in joining the project and help building a better ADISSO.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RELEASE NOTES:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Version 0.1.1.3: January 23, 2012<br>\r\nInitial release.
