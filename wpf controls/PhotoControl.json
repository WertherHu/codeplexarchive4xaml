The screenshot below shows what the work item looks like with the PhotoControl when selected a user with an Active Directory photo in the Assigned To field:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/PhotoControl/985d2b2e-b85b-43a4-a0b2-aee768052c65\" alt=\"PhotoControlSample.png\" title=\"PhotoControlSample.png\" /><br /><br />To upload an Active Directory photo for your user account, you can use the following tool: <a href=\"http://outlookphoto.codeplex.com/\">OutlookPhoto</a><br /><br />The following screeshot shows a snippet from the modified Task work item demonstrates the use of the PhotoControl:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/PhotoControl/852332ed-f94b-428d-89ae-feb4c51f070e\" alt=\"PhotoControlSample2.png\" title=\"PhotoControlSample2.png\" /><br /><br /><b>How Does it Work?</b><br /><br />The operation is pretty simple. You bind a field that allows valid users to the PhotoControl. Where the bound field has a value, the PhotoControl is notified and it searches Active Directory for the user account corresponding to the selected display name. If the user account has a thumbnailPhoto, then that thumbnail photo is displayed in the work item. If the account has not thumbnail photo associated with it, the photo control remains blank.<br /><br /><b>Other Ways to Use the PhotoControl</b><br /><br />You can also use the new PreferredType attribute on the Control to provide a fallback field for the PhotoControl. In the example below, the fallback would be to display the Assigned To field&#39;s Display Name.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/PhotoControl/f15f7621-a572-4a29-bc22-1ac7235c152f\" alt=\"PhotoControlSample3.png\" title=\"PhotoControlSample3.png\" /><br /><br />This is what it will look like if you were to use the Process Editor:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/PhotoControl/5972800d-8c4e-4cde-bbc5-eeb373acc939\" alt=\"PhotoControlSample4.png\" title=\"PhotoControlSample4.png\" /><br /><br /><b>Resources</b><br />\n<ul><li>For more advanced (and cooler) samples, please take a look at the following CodePlex project: <a href=\"http://witcustomcontrols.codeplex.com/\">Custom Controls for TFS Work Item Tracking</a></li>\n<li>A good reference blog post: <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/greggboer/archive/2010/03/30/work-item-tracking-custom-controls.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/greggboer/archive/2010/03/30/work-item-tracking-custom-controls.aspx</a></li></ul>\n<br /><br />Hope you enjoy!<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
