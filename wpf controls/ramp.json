This should then make adjustments to the running user load. <br /><br />For the above to work, in your .loadtest file add the Ramp plugin to it. Ramp plugin for the .loadtest is delivered as one of the 3 installers mentioned above.<br /><br /><b><i>will write a better write up soon, take above as a quick and dirty write up to avoid codeplex from deleting the project</i></b></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
