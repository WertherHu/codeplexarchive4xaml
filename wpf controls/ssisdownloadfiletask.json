I've done minimal cleanup, and the code isn't perfect (and there are few comments) but I could not find anything similar online, and I thought the best thing to do would be to share the code today instead of waiting to polish it before sharing\r\n it.</p>\r\n<p>The initial public release is online so everyone should be able to download the code to use (and tweak) on their own.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'd really appreciate any feedback on whether you think the project isn't feasible, whether you'd like to use it if it were more mature, and that sort of thing.
