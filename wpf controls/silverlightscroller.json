The user can drag the content around with the mouse and then throw it by flicking and releasing the button.  Includes the abiliity to fine-tune friction.<br /><br /><br />This control allows content to be dragged and flung with the mouse, much like what you see on the iPhone, for example.  You can adjust the amount of momentum/friction on the content so that it either stops right after the mouse button is released (high friction) or continues until the end of the control content is reached (low/no friction).<br /><br /><img src=\"http://www.murtaya.com/Mike/CodePlex/SLDragScroller.jpg\" /><br /><br />This control extends the WPF ScrollViewer control.<br /><br />For examples of this control in action (at least the Silverlight 3 version, which should act similarly), see the following pages:\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.mymurtaya.com\">http://www.mymurtaya.com</a>\n<ul><li>Picture pages use the drag scrolling functionality</li>\n<li>Diary pages use the drag scrolling functionality</li></ul></li></ul>\n </div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
