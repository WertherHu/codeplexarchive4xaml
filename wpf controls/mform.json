This technology is based on ASP.NET Forms which seems to fade away. If you still want to do similar stuff that MForm made a little simpler, I would all advise you to take a look\r\n at Knockout.Js, a fantastic javascript MVVM framework which makes is super easy to bind html forms with complex objects.</strong></span></p>\r\n<h3>Latest source code</h3>\r\n<p>If you want to download the latest source code, download <a href=\"https://mform.svn.codeplex.com/svn/trunk/Solutions/MForm\">\r\nhttps://mform.svn.codeplex.com/svn/trunk/Solutions/MForm</a> using svn client of your choice.<br>\r\nIf you download the latest source code using the change set download button, the projects will be missing some folders, as this bundled version does not copy svn:externals in appropriate places.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
