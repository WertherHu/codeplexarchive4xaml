The tool also focusses primarly on SQL Server.<br /><br />The feature complete version will be released on August 30th but this version is complete for as far as the service is concerned. Most work has to be done on the client, but the basics are available.<br /><br />For a quickstart download the binaries and follow the steps in the included Quick Start Guide. To run the tool you will need at least SQL Server 2008.
