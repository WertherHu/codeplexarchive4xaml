Please send me a message.</i><br /><br /><b>Project Description</b><br /><br />This set of libraries may be a good addition to any application that allows the user to customize colors. You can use common patters to visually edit palettes like complimentary colors and also compare W3C color values. <br /><br />You can also switch to different types of color wheel: RGB, RYB (red-yellow-blue), RYGB. <br /><br />My idea was to simplify styling of UI controls, from color perspective: if we try to style button or other control, Expression Blend generates default style template with lots of colors, but mostly, they are just derivatives (lighter, darker, light-to-dark gradient) of small number of base colors.<br /><br />This led me to an idea that control styles could have them written in more generic, and more importantly less redundant and more clear way like this:<br /><br />     Background=&quot;{Binding Source={StaticResource ColorManager}, Path=<a href=\"https://color.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ButtonBackground-Glass-Brush&referringTitle=Home\">ButtonBackground-Glass-Brush</a>}&quot;<br /><br />Library split into 2 parts: (1) core (non UI, palette, RGB, HSB, CIELab, CIEXYZ, converters, tools), (2) - UI, color wheel, color component editors and other UI controls to edit colors and create palettes. <br /><br />Friendly BSD license.<br /><br /><b>Demo</b><br /><br />Demo project located here: <a href=\"http://asyrovprog.host22.com/colorwheel.html\">http://asyrovprog.host22.com/colorwheel.html</a><br /><br />Screenshots:<br /><br />Color Wheel Control palette editor:<br /><img src=\"/projects/color/09561014-3369-4b05-ae29-119c8baaef94\" alt=\"colorwheel_control.jpg\" title=\"colorwheel_control.jpg\" /><br /><br />Brightness-Saturation  palette editor:<br /><img src=\"/projects/color/6b5ca8e3-8349-40de-b8f5-64d76da0a216\" alt=\"brisat.jpg\" title=\"brisat.jpg\" /><br /><br />Color component editor editor:<br /><img src=\"/projects/color/52fcef2f-722f-4da7-99fd-55df25170365\" alt=\"sliders.jpg\" title=\"sliders.jpg\" /><br /><br />This is example of complete form that uses above controls to build application palette editor:<br /><img src=\"/projects/color/f617173d-1137-4a9c-bcab-27e2aa317712\" alt=\"colorwheel.jpg\" title=\"colorwheel.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
