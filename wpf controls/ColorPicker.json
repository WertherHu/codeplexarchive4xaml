The base control had been implemented by Viktar Karpach and you can find it from the codeproject ( http://www.codeproject.com/KB/custom-controls/WS_ColorPicker.aspx). But because there are some issues in usage, I had recreated the control and enhanced it by extending the autopostback feature and onColorChanged event handler, which is similiar to the onTextChanged of the TextBox.",
