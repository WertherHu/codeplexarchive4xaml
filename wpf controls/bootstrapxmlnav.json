Bootstrap provides an amazing responsive framework to build web sites on.  Web applications/sites can be rapidly stood-up with a great responsive look-and-feel.<br /><br />The navigation component of Twitter Bootstrap is beast.  Like many, I like to define my navigation in an external file.  In my case and XML file.<br /><br />Bootstrap XML Navigation is an ASP.NET Server Control which provide the ability to off-load your navigation structure to external XML files. I have used the server control with great success in multiple projects which use Twitter Bootstrap.<br /><br />Ultimately, I wanted to clean up the HTML markup associated with navigation, which the control does, considerably.  The XML associated with a Bootstrap XML Navigation menu is intuitive and easy to modify.<br /><br />I welcome all recommendations to approve upon this code.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
