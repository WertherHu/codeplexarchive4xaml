Also, the xtremeCC comes bundled with whole lot of control and the samples which describe the usage of controls. The documentation project for xtremeCC is underway and will be released only with the final stable build not less than version 1.0.\n\nAll the versions below 1.0, i.e., 0.x are development and beta-only versions which may be labeled stable or not according to the testing done on them. \n\nIf you are interested in development of xtremeCC or have an idea which can greatly enhance the performance/memory footprints of the library, then just drop a mail to me at amitbhandari[at]ruleatwork.co.in.",
