Great for games that run in windowed mode&#33; Developed in C&#35; under .NET 4.0<br />\n<h1>News</h1>\r<h2>Softpedia Listing! (5/19/12)</h2>\rIt seems someone at Softpedia has listed Make Borderless on their site, and it&#39;s gotten 80+ downloads, how cool is that! Made my day for sure. I just found it on there, it was posted on the 8th apparently. Cool!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Make-Borderless.shtml\">Link to SoftPedia</a><br />\n<h2>An Interesting use for Make Borderless (5/3/12)</h2>\rIn playing around with my new creation, I managed to get an idea. With full-screen flash windows (say, youtube), they detect in Make Borderless as a borderless window, and you can uncheck their box to actually GIVE a borderless window, a border! I thought it was fairly neat, and wanted to share that here on the project page! Have fun!<br />\n<h2>Alpha 0.2 Released! (4/30/12)</h2>\rCheck out the <a href=\"http://makeborderless.codeplex.com/releases/view/86976\">Release Page</a>!<br />\n<h1>Screenshots</h1>\r<img src=\"http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3924/capture1kp.png\" /><br /><img src=\"http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/596/capture2hb.png\" /><br /><img src=\"http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/1202/capture3zf.png\" /><br /><img src=\"http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/3570/capture4a.png\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
