Therefore the first issue that every developer who desire to write applications in RTL languages should deal with it, is to find a way to solve this problem. I am aware that a similar project is running to support Arabic and Hebrew languages in Silverlight. The name of this project is &quot;Silverlight 2.0 Hebrew &amp; Arabic Language Support&quot; and it is available in codeplex, too. However my project is not as professional as their project, it might be useful. I am the only developer of this project. You can add your comments here or at <a href=\"http://daneshmandi.spaces.live.com\">http://daneshmandi.spaces.live.com</a><br /><br />This project includes a library which you can use it to convert Persian raw text to a formatted Persian string that can be showed correctly in Silverlight 2.0.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
