The JavaScript library is not dependent on SharePoint, you could use it anywhere. <br /><br />Project contact: me@ danlarson dot com.<br />Read dan&#39;s blog: <a href=\"http://www.danlarson.com\">http://www.danlarson.com</a><br /><br />To deploy, download the source code package, and use Visual Studio to deploy. <br /><br />NewsGator Customers: this WSP is shipped with Social Sites for SharePoint Server 2010 and 2013. Please use the version we include with the release. <br /><br />If you are opening the source code, you will need the Ajax Minifier from here: <a href=\"http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com/\">http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com/</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
