The original assemblies are kept unchanged.<br /><br />Using ControlAdapters and Tag Mapping it&#39;s possible to make individual changes and only use what you really need.<br /><br />A must have behavior that is missing is ability to add CAPTCHA to sensitive forms like contact form, post comment form or user registration. <br />Well ... now you can easily add this:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/ngcsextensions/520c9b0f-2ed3-4711-8941-68577a6ab7d8\" alt=\"CSCaptcha.jpg\" title=\"CSCaptcha.jpg\" /><br /><br />The release binaries are compiled against <b>CommunityServer 2008.5</b>.<br /><br />For usage information see the <a href=\"http://ngcsextensions.codeplex.com/documentation\">Documentation</a> section.<br /><br />For technical details see the following posts:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://nunogomes.net/post/2010/03/31/ASPNETControls_CommunityServer_Captcha_ControlAdapter.aspx\">ASP.NET Controls - CommunityServer Captcha ControlAdapter, a practical case</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
