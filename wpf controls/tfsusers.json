TFS Users is still useful for CLI operations, or if you have more specialized TFS user needs.</b><br /><br />TFSUsers.pl will gather how many users are supported on a given TFS instance. Default TFS installations don&#39;t provide this info without painful drudgery.<br /><br />First, I created this script because in my environment we needed to know how<br />many users we are supporting with TFS, but the default installation does<br />not provide a way to gather or obtain this information.  It will isolate each<br />valid user into a domain ID, then append an email suffex to each one so that<br />notifications may be sent out to your entire user community, for events like<br />outages, upgrades, or other changes.<br /><br />Since TFSUsers.pl is obviously a perl script, you will need a perl<br />interpreter.  Since Windows does not come with that, the standard installation<br />is ActiveState Perl, which you can download for free.  If<br />you don&#39;t want to expose your TFS server to potential vulnerabilities by<br />installing Perl onto it, you may run it from a UNC path that has execute<br />permissions for the ID you will use when running the script.  Just grant that<br />ID execute permissions on your Perl directory (C:\\Perl or something similar) <br />then call the interpreter at the command line via something like this:<br /><br />\\\\computerName\\Perl\\bin\\perl.exe<br /><br />As far as the script goes, you can view the code by simply opening the .pl<br />file in the text editor of your choice.  It is sufficiently documented so <br />if you need to customize to your local environment it shouldn&#39;t be too tricky<br />provided you know Perl.<br /><br />I submitted this to codeplex because there are not a lot of TFS tools written<br />in languages that are outside the usual .Net landscape.  There may have been a<br />more elegant way via the TFS API, but those are all .Net objects.  If anyone <br />feels so inclined to port this to C# or any other CLR language, feel free.  All<br />I ask is that proper credit be given where credit is due.  I&#39;m not sure how<br />portable this code would be because I&#39;m not an expert in the TFS API by any<br />means, but it would at least provide a high level blueprint.<br /><br />For a project by project user audit check out my other tool at http://tfsprojects.codeplex.com<br /><br />Copyright 2014 Jay Eberhard.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
