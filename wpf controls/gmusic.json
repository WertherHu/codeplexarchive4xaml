This was originally just an app for us to use at work and it quickly evolved\r\n into something more. Now that we see a common need we'll be making something a little more reliable and featureful so stay tuned! Thanks for the support :)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Important Notice!</strong></p>\r\n<p>This project was initially something that was just used by a couple of us personally. We're now getting a lot of traffic, which is great, and we'd love to make sure we take care of everyone. There are some issues reported which we will resolve as soon as\r\n possible so as not to waste the attention and support you guys are showing us.&nbsp;Thanks go to&nbsp;<a title=\"Lifehacker Article\" href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5828955/gmusic-puts-google-music-in-your-taskbar-with-a-mini&#43;player-support-for-media-keys\" target=\"_blank\">Lifehacker</a>,&nbsp;<a title=\"Addictive Tips Article\" href=\"http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/desktop-google-music-player-listen-to-your-favorite-music-tracks\" target=\"_blank\">Addictive\r\n Tips</a>&nbsp;and everyone else who has been spreading the word about our application!

This version also has an update notifier so you can automatically be aware when new versions are available. There is still a complication when trying to\r\n install flash from within the player, but until we have that sorted out, if the player starts but says you need flash,\r\n<a title=\"Download Flash\" href=\"http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nclick here</a> and choose Windows in the first dropdown, then choose the version for &quot;Other Browsers&quot; in the second dropdown.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project Description</strong> <br>\r\nA desktop client for <a title=\"Google Music\" href=\"http://music.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nGoogle Music</a> that supports minimize to tray with a draggable playback control bar and support for multimedia keys.
