You&#39;ll no longer have to parse the RDL files and extract and execute queries yourself. It&#39;s developed in C&#35;.<br /><br /><b>Using LRE</b><br />To use LRE, add the <span class=\"codeInline\">LocalReportViewer</span> control to your form and load a report and data. You can then go and refresh the report, which will render it. If all your report references is external data then you&#39;re set! LRE will attempt to connect and query the external data sources for you.<br /><br /><div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">private</span> <span style=\"color:Blue;\">void</span> Form1_Load(<span style=\"color:Blue;\">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n    <span style=\"color:Blue;\">this</span>.reportViewer.LoadReportDefinition(<span style=\"color:#A31515;\">@&quot;C:\\Temp\\Untitled.rdl&quot;</span>);\n    <span style=\"color:Blue;\">this</span>.reportViewer.LoadData();\n    <span style=\"color:Blue;\">this</span>.reportViewer.RefreshReport();\n}\r\n</pre></div><br />Report and query parameters are currently unsupported - the current iteration of LRE is capable of showing simple reports with external data requirements only. See <i>Contributing</i> for more information.<br /><br /><b>Contributing</b><br />The issue tracker shows features that need to be added - later releases will incorporate these features. If you need a feature or extra functionality sooner, post a comment or vote in the issue tracker.<br /><br />You can contribute to this project by submitting patches for new features or bug fixes. Anybody is welcome to review the source code and give me feedback on the program&#39;s architecture and code flow.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
