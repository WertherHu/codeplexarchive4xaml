In the winforms world there is the datagridview. However if you begin to have lots of data (i.e. &gt; 100 elements) it becomes difficult to retrieve the information you need. You would probably want to do what you do with Outlook : grouping the data.<br />But that task is impossible with the standard datagridview which only allows sorting data.<br /><br /><b>Additional information</b><br />This project is a fork of the excellent OutlookGrid from Herre Kuijpers. Therefore the source relies on his project with some parts stripped down, bugs corrections and some enhancements detailed later.<br />Please take a look to the original article : <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14388/OutlookGrid-grouping-and-arranging-items-in-Outloo\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14388/OutlookGrid-grouping-and-arranging-items-in-Outloo</a>.<br /><br />The other goal of the grid is to match the style with the commercial Krypton Suite from Component Factory. It was previously a suite with a free Toolkit component, on which our grid relies on. The entire suite is now open-source and can be found here <a href=\"https://github.com/Cocotteseb/Krypton\">https://github.com/Cocotteseb/Krypton</a>.<br /><br />Finally this grid is used in our applications that are currently in development. You can visit us at JDH Software here : <a href=\"http://www.jdhsoftware.com\">http://www.jdhsoftware.com</a><br /><br /><b>Features</b><br /><br /><u>1. Grouping and nested grouping</u><br /><br />You can group one or several columns (up to all) of the grid. There are also built-in context-menus to interact with the grid.<br /><img src=\"/projects/kryptonoutlookgrid/283496be-03a2-4df2-af0b-b540b910b3a5\" alt=\"grouping.png\" title=\"grouping.png\" /><br /><br /><u>2. Sorting</u><br /><br />You can sort any groups and one non-grouped column. The sorts takes care about the types in the grid.<br /><img src=\"/projects/kryptonoutlookgrid/da9ff442-212e-49f3-9b65-37dd056cc390\" alt=\"sorting.png\" title=\"sorting.png\" /><br /><br /><u>3. Custom columns</u><br /><br />The grid includes custom columns such a progress column, Image and Text Column.<br /><img src=\"/projects/kryptonoutlookgrid/b3167f3f-1813-413e-8f6a-7662e9e4b790\" alt=\"customcolumns.png\" title=\"customcolumns.png\" /><br /><br /><u>4. Performance</u><br /><br />The grid offers relatively good performance to my sense. <br />In the KryptonOutlookGrid SandBox, there are 2000 rows. Grouping Name, Country and Address takes around 50 to 60 ms. Just test yourself ! (the data file is the same of the original outlook grid)<br />But that heavily depends on the number of rows, the depth of grouping, the number of columns, the types to compare,... etc.<br />To sum up in most scenarios it will be fine.<br /><br /><u>5. Krypton and Office styling</u><br /><br />The grid is <b>Krypton</b> aware, that means it adapts its rendering with Krypton components.<br /><br /><b>Limitations</b><br /><br />There are some limitations with this grid :<br />- No databinding capabilities (unbound mode only)<br />- Virtual mode not tested, but shouldn&#39;t function.<br />- Others that I do not have in mind ? :)<br /><br /><b>Roadmap</b><br /><br />The control will evolve with the different projects lead by JDH Software, but who knows with the help of the community too ?<br /><br /><b>History</b><br /><br />See here <br /><br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />I hope you will enjoy using it in your projects. Tell me where you use it, I&#39;m interested to see it in action !<br />I would like to thank Herre Kuijpers for his original work that helps me a lot to achieve this and his agreement to make a fork. As him I would like to share what I&#39;ve managed to do and I hope it can help other people.<br /><br />Oh and visit us to try our applications when they will be released. (or subscribe to the BETA channels) ;)<br /><a href=\"http&#58;&#47;&#47;www.jdhsoftware.com\"><img src=\"/projects/kryptonoutlookgrid/60a23331-ae61-48a5-9b85-4dfe77d57521\" alt=\"JDH&#32;Software\" title=\"JDH&#32;Software\" /></a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
