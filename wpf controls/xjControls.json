They&#39;ve reached a decent level of polish so I thought I&#39;d start a repository and package some of these things up.<br /><br />I want to deliver easy to implement jQuery plugins, like <a href=\"https://xjcontrols.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=xjStatusBar&referringTitle=Home\">xjStatusBar</a>, that can also leverage the great design of jQuery UI.<br /><br />I just started this with some bare bones ASP.Net projects today. I have yet to seed the guts of the plugin properly and get the simple sample online. Ideally, I want to demonstrate xjControls in the ASP.Net MVC template that I included in the source.<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
