This means that it is only responsible for displaying touch screen interfaces and sending user interactions such as screen touches or mouse clicks to the Touch Service. The Touch Service processes user\r\n interactions, monitors dynamic screen changes and sends screen updates to the Touch Screen Viewer Lite application.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouch screen interfaces can be created and edited with the Touch Screen Builder application, or imported from other user systems.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
