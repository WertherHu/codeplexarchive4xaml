  "Title": "Axial - Easy JavaScript in .NET",
  "Description": "Axial lets you write .NET code that will be converted to JavaScript for use on the web. The goal is to make JavaScript more accessible to C# and VB programmers who are comfortable using Visual Studio.\n\nThis is very useful in some scenarios, such as form validation. You could write your validation function in C#, add an Axial Validator control, and you that code will be run in JavaScript, giving a better user experience. In fact, one of the controls lets you to use one function as both the client side and server side form validator. This also allows all code to be in one language, enables Intellisense, and increases the power of JavaScript.\n\nAxial is generally used in WebForms through controls. You only need to place a control and specify the name of the method. Specialized controls are available to run code when the page loads or the form is submitted. AJAX is available through PageMethods and JSON. jQuery integration has been implemented, and there's no reason why other JavaScript libraries couldn't be integrated in the future. ASP.Net MVC will be a future target.\n\nAxial is not complete and may not be feasible in the real world. However, I thought I would let the world decide, rather than keeping the code to myself.",
