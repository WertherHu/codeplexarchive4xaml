This project offers a professionally\r\n designed database along with appropriate stored procedures to record and keep this data up to date.&nbsp; The design philosophy is to not require any additional objects on the target servers, instances, or databases, yet after seeding a minimum of server and\r\n instance information maintain a schuled update of databases throught the organization.</p>\r\n<p>SSRS reporting is a major component of the project&nbsp;where by the data is exposed to a wider audience (read management) and permits quick answers to complex questions.</p>\r\n<p>The project also contains a minimal amount of SSIS packages that&nbsp;perform the scheduled updates.</p>\r\n<p>The final component is a GUI to enable what manual data entry is required and to more easily control the application as a whole.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br>\r\n</strong></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
