All the patient names and data are fictitious, but the clinical data was built to simulate realistic patient data to the degree possible.<br /><br />Note that to run Aqua, you need to install some basic software components. Details for installing these components are described in the <a href=\"http://healthcare.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=29556\">Release Notes</a> and in the first Hands-on-Lab (see below), so a quick review of the lab will help if you are not familiar with the technologies illustrated in Aqua.<br /><br />The Username for accessing Aqua is AquaDoctor1@Live.com while the Password is infradoc1.<br /><br />There are 17 patients in Aqua and selection of any patient will allow you to explore Aqua&#39;s capabilities. However, the first 2 patients in the patient list (John Rizzo &amp; Duncan Jeldree) have data for several visits or admittances to the hospital, so exploring Aqua using these patients will allow the best illustration of the applications&#39;s functionality.<br /><br /><b>Project Plans - the Road Ahead</b><br />Learn about the plans for a cool learning tool covering Windows Azure, Healthcare, MVVM, LiveID, and ADO.NET Data Services.
