The robot side code is a extended version of the WPILib dashboard demo code.<br /><br />The PCs side uses relatively straight forward .net code. There are some asynchronous network calls, but nothing more complicated than that. The UI is written in WPF, and uses Prisim to allow easy integration of other functionality. Users are able to create their own dashboard views, and by using WPF data binding are it is very quick and easy to customize the UI.
