Examples include HTMLTidy, CSSTidy, and the YUICompressor.\n\nIt also combines files (CSS, JS, for example) into a single file and updates references in the site to the newly combined file. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and improves performance.\n\nCaching assets is also a major issue with web apps, so Sonic can rename selected files within the site to include a datestamp postfix, and update all references to the new postfixed filename. This ensures the resource will be re-downloaded next time the page is accessed.",
