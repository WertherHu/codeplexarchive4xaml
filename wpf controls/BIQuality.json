The suite is based on NUnit and supports quite a lot of different testing methods.</b><br /><br />Having made subtle changes or after refactoring their ETL chain, BI developers can rely on automated tests whether their processes still produce the expected figures - both using SQL and MDX.<br /><br />For example it can automatically compare result sets from different sources, for example SQL and MDX. This allows to define test scenarios the system must meet after the OLAP cube has been loaded. For migration projects it can still run queries against the old system and compare the results with the new system. As everything can be automated, tests can be run on a regular basis (for example directly after every cube processing) to make sure, that all facts are really complete and correct.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://biquality.codeplex.com/releases/view/54543\">Version 2.0.1 is now released</a><br /><a href=\"http://biquality.codeplex.com/releases/view/44019\">Plans for Release 3.0.0</a>\n<h4>Test-Scenarios</h4>\r\n<ul><li>Structure tests</li>\n<li>Data-availability tests</li>\n<li>ForeignKey tests</li>\n<li>Unknown Member tests</li>\n<li>Constraint tests</li>\n<li>Compare tests</li></ul>\n<br /><b><a href=\"http://www.nunit.org/\">NUnit</a> is required</b><br />\n<h4>Screenshots</h4>\r\n<img src=\"/projects/BIQuality/0382ce47-c807-4053-8bea-35e885b8389d\" alt=\"Test&#32;without&#32;Error\" title=\"Test&#32;without&#32;Error\" /> <br />Successful test run<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/BIQuality/a3e8d71f-81cf-4fdc-a39f-18eacf33edfe\" alt=\"Test&#32;with&#32;error\" title=\"Test&#32;with&#32;error\" /><br />Test run with errors<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/BIQuality/c5d6ec1a-8511-469f-a3e0-27e4c0793c7d\" alt=\"HTML&#32;Output\" title=\"HTML&#32;Output\" /><br />Output in HTML<br />\n<h4>Features</h4>\r\n<ul><li>Automatic query tests against SQL Server via OLEDB</li>\n<li>Automatic query tests against Analysis Services via OLEDB</li>\n<li>Unlimited number of connections, referenced by name</li>\n<li>Compare table result against row count</li>\n<li>Record table results</li>\n<li>Compare current table result against a former result</li>\n<li>Compare fields of a result set against a static value +/- tolerance</li>\n<li>Internal configuration tests</li>\n<li>User documentation incl. quick start</li>\n<li>Sample project based on Adventure Works </li>\n<li>Easy deployment</li>\n<li>Grouping of test cases in categories (eg.
