I found it to be ridiculously buggy, so here is a new implementation which appears to work well!<br />\n<h1>Original License</h1>\r&quot;Do what you will with the control. I take responsibility for nothing :-) The source code is free for everyone to copy if they want. I dont care too much. Would be nice to know where its used though, thats about it.&quot;<br />- <i>Glav</i>, <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/pglavich/archive/2006/03/14/440191.aspx#6806755\">http://weblogs.asp.net/pglavich/archive/2006/03/14/440191.aspx#6806755</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
