The YSGetLatest simplifies getting last version from TFS. The application allows getting last source code for set of folders. The application allows browsing command execution log.<br /><br />I work in a big project. We use Team Foundation Server (TFS) as Concurrent Versions System (CVS). The project has many branches. Each branch has many folders (solutions).<br />I start each morning with getting latest source code from TFS. The Visual Studio 2010 has very good opportunities to work with TFS but I can&#39;t perform get latest for set of folders: either all folders in a branch or folder by folder.<br />The YSGetLatest allows to perform get latest for set of folders.<br /><br /><b><a href=\"https://ysgetlatest.codeplex.com/documentation?referringTitle=Home\">Documentation</a></b><br /><br /><b>Screen Shot</b><br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/YSGetLatest/703e09b3-0970-44d0-9ae7-1ecf6e5a9d26\" alt=\"Project.jpg\" title=\"Project.jpg\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http&#58;&#47;&#47;www.softpedia.com&#47;progClean&#47;YSGetLatest-Clean-198200.html\"><img src=\"/projects/YSGetLatest/3bb25c57-e98e-4d6f-b723-432cae5e6f28\" alt=\"Softpedia&#32;Free&#32;Award\" title=\"Softpedia&#32;Free&#32;Award\" /></a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
