I have released a beta version with Wii MotionPlus support, but it is buggy and incomplete.  If you want to play around with it, please download version <a href=\"http://wiimotelib.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=30401\">1.8 beta</a> but be aware it will be buggy and it&#39;s mostly unsupported at the moment.  Otherwise, stick to the current, stable version 1.7.<br /><br />This project started life as an article for Microsoft&#39;s <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/Managed-Library-for-Nintendos-Wiimote\">Coding4Fun</a> website.  A full set of API docs can be found in the release package.  Basic usage and some internal details are all documented at the original C4F <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/03/14/1879033.aspx\">article</a>.<br /><br />I have compiled a <a href=\"http://www.brianpeek.com/blog/pages/net-based-wiimote-applications.aspx\">list of applications</a> that are using the library.  Feel free to <a href=\"http://www.brianpeek.com/blog/contact.aspx\">contact me</a> with your creations so I can add them to the list.<br /><br />Also check out <a href=\"http://www.wiimotelib.org\">http://www.wiimotelib.org/</a> for more information.<br /><br /><b>I feel like I’m running out of things to implement and bugs to fix.  I know that’s not true.  So, I want to hear from the people using my library…</b><br /><br /><b>What features/bugs do you want to see added/fixed?  Please <a href=\"http://www.brianpeek.com/blog/contact.aspx\">contact me directly</a> so I can create a master list.  Thanks!</b></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
