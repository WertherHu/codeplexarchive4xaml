ASP.NET provides a great foundation of controls, but often we need to go a little bit futher in our development projects.  ASP.NET Real World Controls attempt to capture those common scenarios and create reusable controls out of them.<br /><br />This project was originally available on GotDotNet, but we&#39;ve moved to CodePlex.  In addition to moving to CodePlex, we&#39;ve also expanded the scope of the project.  While we originally focused on GridView only, now we&#39;ll expand to other ASP.NET controls as well.<br /><br />Here is some documentation.  <br /><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/mattdotson/articles/490868.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/mattdotson/articles/490868.aspx</a><br /><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/mattdotson/articles/541795.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/mattdotson/articles/541795.aspx</a><br /><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/mattdotson/archive/2006/03/02/real-world-gridview-excel-like-frozen-headers-for-asp-net-2-0.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/mattdotson/archive/2006/03/02/real-world-gridview-excel-like-frozen-headers-for-asp-net-2-0.aspx</a><br />Keep in mind that some of these posts were about older versions of the code, and that some of the code might have changed since then.
