All you have to do is put it on your website and run the Default.aspx page. It uses a SQL Server database for the data source and should be easily integrated with any website design.<br /><br /><b><u>NOTE</u></b>: Because NetGuest installs it&#39;s own data source, dbcreator access to SQL Server&#39;s master database is required. Also, NetGuest tries to access this database by using the username <b>sa</b> and password <b>sa</b>. If this is incorrect, or you are able to create databases on SQL Server, please replace these values with your login details (see the text file attached)<br /><br />Any feedback on my first application will be greatly appreciated. Obviously I&#39;m working on fixing a few issues (such as the one detailed above).<br /><br />Look out for v1.2 !!!</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
