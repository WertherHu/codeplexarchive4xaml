I've done minimal cleanup, and the code isn't perfect (and there are few comments). The initial public release is online so everyone should be able to download the code to use (and tweak) on their own.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'd really appreciate any feedback on whether you think the project isn't feasible, whether you'd like to use it if it were more mature, and that sort of thing.
