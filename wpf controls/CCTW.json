This project provides you with an application-integrated interface for mapping content controls to custom XML data files as well as other operations revolving around custom XML in Word. You will find this project similar to the Content Control Toolkit hosted on Codeplex at <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/dbe\">http://www.codeplex.com/dbe</a> with the main difference being the integration inside Microsoft Word versus an external application. <br /><br />This project uses Visual Studio Tools for Office v3 as well as Windows Presentation Foundation to provide a rich and intuitive interface for performing custom XML related tasks. As a result you require the .NET 3.5 to run the code. <br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/CCTW/3799d49d-e591-4e50-8149-b3550d658a39\" alt=\"CCTW.jpg\" title=\"CCTW.jpg\" /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
