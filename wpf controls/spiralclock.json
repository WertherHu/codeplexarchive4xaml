  "Description": "SpiralClock is a UserControl developed in WPF that allows you to arrange events on a 24h spiral clock. It can be templated.",
  "MovedLink": "",
  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\"><h2>Project Description</h2>\rThis is a spiral clock made entirely in WPF &amp; C#, which can be used as a time - scheduler. Events are arranged along the Archimedean spiral and can easily be moved by dragging them with the mouse. Spiral clock is fully template-able, as it inherits from Selector. The time-now-indicator and the hour labels are also template-able.<br /><br />The first release contains the control source and a demo project as well.<br /><br /><br /><b>NEWS</b>: An enhanced SpiralClock will be uploaded soon, inheriting from the ListoBox class. <br />In addition, a new control will be included : the stripes panel, that makes a stripe in a vertical area, depending on a time value. <br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Note:</b> The spiral vector contained in the project was based on the svg found here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archimedean_spiral.svg\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archimedean_spiral.svg</a> and is therefore under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic License. Usage of this control must be in compliance with that license or else you can remove the spiral background - the control works fine without it.<br />\n<h2>Join</h2>\rThe project seeks feedback and contributors!<br />\n<h2>Screenshot</h2>\r\n<img src=\"/projects/spiralclock/2455d47b-c965-41b9-a34a-ae311ab8740f\" alt=\"shot01.png\" title=\"shot01.png\" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>License</b><br />This software and it&#39;s source code is under the MIT License<br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
