Unfortunately, Visual Studio 2005 does not provide a direct way to place these controls on a page. Even after they have been manually placed, there is no easy way to interact with them using server-side code.<br /><br />The aim of this project is to create a set of ASP.NET 2.0 controls which will allow embedding the OWC controls on an ASP.NET page, and also provide a way to write server-side code using them. </div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
