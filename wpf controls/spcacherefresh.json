However once you have cached something it becomes difficult to control it's life in the cache and when they expire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how do you invalidate those objects? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYouc could reset IIS or use some query string type process to notify that the object should be removed.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that works for one process on the server and also does not update any other servers in the SharePoint farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing this framework you will be able to add support to automatically configure the objects added to the cache to be refreshed on a regular basis across SharePoint processes on all SharePoint servers. You will also be able to force a refresh if the objects\r\n need to be updated after a change in configuration.<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Features\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Control an object's lifetime in the cache across the SharePoint Farm </li><li>Configured using SharePoint User Interface or using PowerShell Cmdlets </li><li>Define different configurations for different types of objects </li><li>Improve the experience of your users/system administration team as they makes changes to your system\r\n</li><li>Example usage patterns provided</li></ul>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\r\nTo get start then go to the <a href=\"/documentation\">Documentation section</a> for how to get started.<br>\r\n<h2>Getting Involved</h2>\r\nIf you would like to get involved in the project then please contact me via the Discussion Board\r\n<a href=\"https://spcacherefresh.codeplex.com/discussions\">https://spcacherefresh.codeplex.com/discussions</a><br>\r\n<h2>Feedback</h2>\r\nPlease provide feedback using the Discusssions tab <a href=\"https://spcacherefresh.codeplex.com/discussions\">\r\nhttps://spcacherefresh.codeplex.com/discussions</a><br>\r\n<h2>Issues / Bugs</h2>\r\nPlease report issues/bugs using the Issue Tracker <a href=\"https://spcacherefresh.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic\">\r\nhttps://spcacherefresh.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic</a><br>\r\n<h2>Feature Requests</h2>\r\nTo ask for additional features please add a post to the Feature Requests post in the Discussions tab\r\n<a href=\"https://spcacherefresh.codeplex.com/discussions\">https://spcacherefresh.codeplex.com/discussions</a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope that you find the framework useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
