  "Title": "verinfo - File/PE-Image Version Information Application",
  "Description": "The \"verinfo\" application is a command line application that will show you version information (and more!) for either a single file, multiple files or even a complete directory. It has some optional features like MD5/SHA1 generation, HTML Output, Logging Output to a file and/or System Debug Output. For that reason it comes with a own Debug Output Reader named \"verinfodbg\" that lets you monitor and save debug output on your local system like Sysinternals great DbgView. It also has a helper application named \"ods\" (Output Debug String) that simply writes Output to the Systems OutputDebugString Buffer for testing purposes, Many settings can be made inside the verinfo.ini configuration file, which has some very interesting extra application features like extra PE image information, debugging control, html output control, tuning settings, memory (de)allocation settings, application flow, console output features, etc,.... Since the verinfo.ini is a plain-text ini file, it can be edited with a simple text editor, but it also has its own simple command line editor \"verinfoini\" that can help you edit its content if there is no user interface available by, for example accessing the remote system from ssh or telnet. Our \"verinfo\" also comes with a basic symbolic debugger named \"verinfosym\", which still is in development, but has some basic features like, single stepping, full run, create mini debug dump for e.g. the Microsoft Windows Debugger (WinDbg) or another debugger that can read the dump files content. The \"verinfo\", \"verinfodbg\", \"verinfoini\" and \"ods\" applications are proven stable and realiable for daily work and can be considered as stable releases, whereas the helping application \"verinfosym\" is considered experimental alpha and under development, though it works for really simple debugging the verinfo suit and maybe other windows apps.\n\nThe \"verinfo\" applictions and all its tools are written entirely in Visual C++ (2008) for maximum performance and extensibility.",

If you dont have a copy of it, you still can fully edit and develop/extend and compile the application by using the Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition that also works fine for the applications project files.<br /><br />Go here to get a free copy of <b>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition</b>:  <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/\">http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/</a><br />If you only want to debug the app without code or want to run it with a fully fledged debugger then i recommend the usage of the <b>Debugging Tools for Windows</b>: <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/Debugging/\">http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/Debugging/</a><br /><br />If you have questions, dont hesitate, just ask!<br />Have fun and happy coding!<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Kerem G&#252;mr&#252;kc&#252;<br /><a href=\"mailto:kerem.g@arcor.de\">Email Kerem G&#252;mr&#252;kc&#252;</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
