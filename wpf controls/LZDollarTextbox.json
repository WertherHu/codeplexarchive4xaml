Basic formatting for US currency and comma separation are provided</b><br /><br />LZDollarTextbox is an ASP.Net server control that makes handling numeric only data easier for web applications.  It is developed in VB.Net &#40;easy to convert to C&#35;&#41; and Javascript.<br /><br /><b>Background</b><br />This control was developed due to an odd lack of anything in the open source domain that really fulfilled the requirement for a simple numeric only textbox that handles basic US numeric/currency formatting.  There are plenty of tutorials that demo how to almost get the complete functionality, but nothing that&#39;s just simple to include in your project and register on a form.  <br /><br />The code is pretty straightforward VB.net and javascript.  The javascript is registered as a resource in the compiled assembly and inserted into your target page upon execution, so no additional files are necessary for distribution.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />-Rick Little<br /><br /><br />The control is based on the standard asp.net textbox control so it works with databinding as you&#39;d expect.   A sample Visual Studio 2008 Solution with a web application is included for testing.<br /><br /><b>Basic Usage</b>\n<ol><li>Include Assembly with your project</li>\n<li>Register tag for your page ex. &lt;%@ Register Assembly=&quot;NumericTextBox&quot; Namespace=&quot;LZDollarTextBox&quot; TagPrefix=&quot;cc1&quot; %&gt;</li>\n<li>Setup control ex. &lt;cc1:NumericTextBox ID=&quot;DIO&quot; ControlWidth=&quot;120&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; AllowDecimal=&quot;True&quot; Text=&quot;1232.2123122&quot; DecimalPlaces=&quot;4&quot; CanWrite=&quot;True&quot; DollarSign=&quot;False&quot; /&gt;</li></ol></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
