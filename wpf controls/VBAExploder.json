Its primary purpose is to aid in the usage of source control systems with VBA projects.<br /><br />There isn&#39;t much to see here yet... I&#39;ll update this as we go along. Hopefully this will turn in to a useful tool.<br /><br /><b>Update Aug 3rd, 2007</b><br />Sorry there hasn&#39;t been any progress on this yet... times have been busy. It hasn&#39;t totally fallen off the radar though.<br /><br /><b>Update Oct 31st, 2007</b><br />I have decided to discontinue this project due to the availability of a similar utility at <a href=\"http://www.appspro.com/Utilities/CodeCleaner.htm\">http://www.appspro.com/Utilities/CodeCleaner.htm</a>. Please see <a href=\"http://home.infusionblogs.com/thunter/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=21\">http://home.infusionblogs.com/thunter/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=21</a> for more info.<br /><br />Does anybody know how to remove a discontinued project from CodePlex?</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
