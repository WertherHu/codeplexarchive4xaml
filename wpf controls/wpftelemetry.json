In spite of the technical-sounding name this is pretty Lo-Fi stuff - a couple of calls to get some system information, a dictionary to store how often a feature is used, a timer that goes off periodically and a service to collect the information. It should be easy to bend to your needs to record the kinds of things your need to know about how people are using your application.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
