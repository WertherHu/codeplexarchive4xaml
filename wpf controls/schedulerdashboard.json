The amount of time by which a task is considered to be late\r\n can be configured on the control, as well as the number of past days the report should display.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: when exporting the data, this module will only consider the active tasks that are delayed for more than 5 minutes in the last 7 days. There is currently no way why which the active settings on the page can be passed to the export option.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Sample screenshot on&nbsp;DNN 6 (pre beta)</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=schedulerdashboard&DownloadId=252462\" alt=\"Scheduler Dashboard in DNN 6\"></p>\r\n<p><em>Sample screenshot on DNN 5.6.2</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=schedulerdashboard&DownloadId=252463\" alt=\"Scheduler Dashboard\" width=\"800\" height=\"378\"></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
