When it is started it will invoke the SDM and listen on the default port 3443 <i>(this can be changed in the config file)</i> for connections.<br /><br />Each line sent from any of the TCP connections will be sent to the SDM, any responses from the SDM will be sent to all the TCP connections. If the SDM dies, the service will attempt to restart it.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
