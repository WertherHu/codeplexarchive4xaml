He wanted to have something similar and so developed a small tool to load snippets of text into the clipboard (so not like the Mac tool). In the process he decided he wanted to do three other things\n<ul><li>Develop it in WPF - the reasoning being, that the UI could look better with a gradient or something.</li>\n<li>Develop it for Windows 7 - so it lights up the icon when you copy to the clipboard, and you can right click the icon to see what is loaded (in case you forget).</li>\n<li>Spend time working on a UI that is intuitive - part of this app design was do not be a Windows app in feel. Rather have a very simple interface for working with the snippets - so some things like saving are automatic with hints when you do something it will do for you.</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Icons</h2>\rThis application makes use of free icons from\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.wefunction.com\">http://www.wefunction.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.Iconkits.com\">http://www.Iconkits.com</a></li></ul>\n<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
