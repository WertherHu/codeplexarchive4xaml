It is planned to add several more points each with their own unique control codes, to allow access to different X-Mouse layers depending on which part of the mouse is covered.<br /><br /><b>Common uses</b><br />Middle Mouse Button: Assigning the Middle Control Point to Layer 2 in X-Mouse, and reassigning the Right Click to a Middle Click in that very layer.
