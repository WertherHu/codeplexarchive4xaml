This is very good point to use on your own SCRUM meetings! I hate to do it manually.</li>\n<li>see statistics for the tasks and developers</li>\n<li>see what tasks have each developer from the your team.</li>\n<li>see what tasks you can assign for developers.</li>\n<li>create reports for TP, SVN and any other custom data sources. (In development)</li>\n<li>simple automation to divide tasks by developers (based on neuron networks) (In development)</li></ul>\n<br />For now, this tool is created to use with TargetProcess and Svn, but you can add your own data provider and work with other systems</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
