It also uses speech synthesis to confirm your commands.<br /><br />This project is in its very early changes. Any code which I check in might be incomplete.<br /><br /><b>Examples of speech recognition commands</b>:<br />- <i>Computer, turn on the bedroom lights</i><br />- <i>Corner office lights off</i><br /><br /><b>Requirements to run it</b>:<br />- A Windows PC with .NET 4<br />- ISY 994i with Insteon hardware (tested with firmware 4.0.5)<br />- A decent microphone (this is crucial!)<br /><br /><b>Requirements to build it</b>:<br />- <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40787\">Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop</a><br />- <a href=\"https://stylecop.codeplex.com\">StyleCop v4.7</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
