It&#39;s pretty simple and straight forward. First, if it&#39;s the first time you work on the specified project on the client computer, you need to create the mapping between your local sources and the Team Foundation Server repository of the project. Once the mapping is made, the project will be displayed on the main panel of the client. Then you can select the project you want to work on and do your CheckIn, Update and Add Files.<br /><br />TSVcClient use the Team Foundation Dlls included in the VS2005 Team Suite install, so it needs to be installed on the client computer. <br /><br />Functionalities:\n<ul><li>Create Working Folder</li>\n<li>Add Files</li>\n<li>Update Files</li>\n<li>CheckIn</li>\n<li>Merge Conflicts</li>\n<li>Credantial management for HTTPS</li></ul>\n<br />This is a first Draft, you can leave us your comments or wanted features: <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/TSVcClient/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=12512\">Forum</a><br /><br />Download: <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/TSVcClient/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx\">TSVcClient v1.2</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://tsvcclient.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=About%20the%20authors&referringTitle=Home\">About the authors</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
