  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\"><div class=wikidoc><strong>Project Description</strong><br>This is a .net user control, which simplifies the task of integrating the embed.ly service into an asp.net project.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>I created this control as part of an umbraco project where i wanted to give authors the ability to embed rich media in the content.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>Simply set the media url property on the user control, and it should show rich content from the +100 oembed services which emebd.ly supports.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc><a href=\"http://embed.ly/\">emebd.ly</a> offers a great service which makes integrating rich media from sites such as youtube, vimeo, imgur and many more very easy. It is based on the oembed standard.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>Getting everything set up can be a bit of a pain though. Therefore I created this control, to minimize the setup and integration time. There still is a lot of space for improvement. It all depends on how you wish to use it. :)</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>Requirements:</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>- jquery 1.3+</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>- jquery.emebdly (http://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery)</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>(both included in the the test web application project)</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>General Usage:</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>1. Get the source code</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>2. Go to embedly regex generator and decide which services you need to intergrate</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>Note: as you will see, the regex generator currently does not support any .net based languages. Therefore choose the &quot;plain&quot; javascript generation and copy the regex to the clipboard.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>3. Go to the EmbedlyHelper Class and replace the value inside the declaration of the strEmbdlyRegex, with the value from your clipboard. This should leave you with something like:</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">string</span> strEmbdlyRegex = <span style=\"color:#a31515\">@&quot;/http:\\/\\/(.*youtube\\.com\\/watch.*|.*\\.youtube\\.com\\/v\\/.*|youtu\\.be\\/.*|.*\\.youtube\\.com\\/us..</span>......</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>Note: The EmebdlyHelper will take care of the &quot;conversion&quot; from Javascript Regex to C# Regex.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>4. Place the control on page and set the EmbedlyUrl property. e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvfn8QlXPG8 to embed a YouTube video.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>5. Test and hopefully be happy.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc></div>\n<div class=wikidoc>See it in action at <a href=\"http://www.youtipit.org/en/about\">http://www.youtipit.org</a></div>\n<div class=wikidoc>&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=wikidoc><strong>Screenshots</strong>:</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>Visual Studio:</div>\n<div class=wikidoc><img src=\"http://www.grombach.com/images/codeplexEmbedlyNet1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=774 height=277></div>\n<div class=wikidoc><br>Results in:</div>\n<div class=wikidoc><br><strong><img src=\"http://www.grombach.com/images/codeplexEmbedlyNet2.jpg\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;</strong></div></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
