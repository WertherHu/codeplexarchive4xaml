  "Description": "DarkXL is a Hardware Accelerated remake of  Dark Forces. It requires the original game data, and will fully support the original game - with cutscenes, briefings and other features. In addition user mods and levels will be supported. \n\nThe point of this project is to allow people to play Dark Forces in high resolution, on windows in either “classic” mode (no new features) or “extended” mode. All modes will benefit from newer control methods like mouse look, high resolutions and color depth. The extended version will get new features such as real-time lighting, slopes, dual adjoins, vertical adjoinds, better model support (md2 and/or md3) and more.",
