Basically, it provides a javascript interface to be used at any platform. Thus, having basic javascript knowledge is enought to use&amp;handle this API. However, those who are not familiar with handling javascript (or generally client scripting) are tend to use&amp;handle components&amp;objects that provide the target functionality. In the case of using this API on some web pages, it seemed to me more proper to create a web control that I could handle on server side.
