  "Description": "This is an assembly that generates a .il source file for emitted code with the correct breakpoints built-in for debugging purposes. It has the same binary interface with the Builder classes in System.Reflection.Emit to make it relatively painless to replace current code with this API.\n\nWARNING: This code is extremely alpha-based! It compiles and the tests pass, but it's woefully in need of more unit tests and code clean-up (but I wanted to publish it and get it under source control). I plan on adding more unit tests in the very near future.",
