In a crude term, a captcha control shows some hard-to-read letters on\r\n the screen and asks the user to enter the text in a box. Then checks to see whether the entered text is correct or not.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis project includes a free and open-source C# 3.0 (ASP.NET) control with the following features:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Is developed as an .ascx control so it is reusable in every ASP.NET website.<br>\r\n2. Saves nothing on your hard-disk so if you open a page in two different windows (or tabs) there will be no conflict between two Captcha controls.<br>\r\n3. Is very easy to use and needs no complicated concept like understanding and using http handlers.<br>\r\n4. One can use several instances on a page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease visit the author's page here: http://aspguy.wordpress.com</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=VKFX6MAUVKD38\"><img src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif\" alt=\"Donate Button with Credit Cards\" width=\"147\" height=\"47\"></a></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
