Rich&#39;s articles would be essential reading for those thinking about contributing to the CABDevExpress.ExtensionKit.<br /><br /><i>The BankTeller Sample Application (from the CAB distribution) modified to use DevExpress controls and the CABDevExpress.ExtensionKit:</i><br /><img src=\"/projects/CABDevExpress/f848ff94-ca9b-49bd-bd7e-8d40a0033feb\" alt=\"BankTellerCABDevExpressSpringtimeSkin.png\" title=\"BankTellerCABDevExpressSpringtimeSkin.png\" /><br /><br />It&#39;s unlikely I&#39;ll be making any further changes to this project as I move on to different and varied projects but I would still be willing to take any feedback and make some changes if I can.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
