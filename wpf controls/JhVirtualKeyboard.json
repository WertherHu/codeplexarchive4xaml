This targets implementations that use WPF, and soon - Windows 8. With it - you now have a way to provide your users with the ability to enter characters in different languages and alphabets, or any Unicode character. Developed in C#, currently using Visual Studio 2013 and .NET 4.5.1, the downloads include earlier versions. If it is requested, I will maintain a separate versions for Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2008.<br /><br />More information can be found on <a href=\"http://designforge.wordpress.com/2011/01/06/jhvirtualkeyboard/\">my blog article</a> at: http://designforge.wordpress.com/2011/01/06/jhvirtualkeyboard/<br /><br />See also the LogNut logging library at <a href=\"https://lognut.codeplex.com\">https://lognut.codeplex.com</a><br /><br />by James W.
