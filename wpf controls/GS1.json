All the xml files are handled with tinyXML. It is a shoot&#39;em up with a vertical scrolling where the player controls a dragon flying in Central Park. The goal is to go through the level until the boss.<br /><br />Game Features<br /><br />    * Three levels of difficulties : the enemies can shoot and move faster.<br />    * Sound on/off.<br />    * Five different enemies following routes.<br />    * Vertical scrolling for backgrounds and clouds. It creates a parallax as the clouds go faster than the backgrounds.<br />    * Boss in 3 parts attacking from different points.<br />    * Every component is black boxed so reusable for a different game (singleton pattern and factory pattern).<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
