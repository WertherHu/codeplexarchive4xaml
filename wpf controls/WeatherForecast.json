There are several weather feed controls on the web, but very few of them allow the developer full control over ALL weather elements sent by the provider.  Weather.com offers a wealth of information in their XML feeds.  This control allows you to select which attributes of the weather you would like to display as well as the option for up to 10 days of weather forecasting.  MjcWeather comes with 5 embedded skins (blue, green, red, yellow, and slate).  You can also use a customize the look an feel with your own skin.  I&#39;m always open to suggestions or tips, so feel free to email me if you have any!<br /><br /><img src=\"http://www.technullogy.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/MyWeather.jpg\" /><br /><br /><pre>\n&lt;MJC:Weather ID=&quot;WeatherForecast1&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;\n                CustomSkin=&quot;&quot;\n                DisplayUnits=&quot;Imperial&quot;\n                EmbeddedSkin=&quot;Blue&quot;\n                EnableCaching=&quot;true&quot;\n                EnableEmbeddedSkins=&quot;true&quot;\n                ForecastDaysToDisplay=&quot;4&quot;\n                ForecastIconSize=&quot;Small&quot;\n                LicenseKey=&quot;xxxxx&quot; \n                LocationId=&quot;72745&quot; \n                PartnerId=&quot;xxxxx&quot;\n                ShowBarometer=&quot;true&quot;\n                ShowChanceForPrecipitation=&quot;true&quot;\n                ShowDayInForecast=&quot;true&quot;\n                ShowDewpoint=&quot;true&quot;\n                ShowForecast=&quot;true&quot;\n                ShowHumidity=&quot;true&quot;\n                ShowLinks=&quot;true&quot;\n                ShowTwcLogo=&quot;true&quot;\n                ShowUvIndex=&quot;False&quot; \n                ShowVisibility=&quot;False&quot; \n                ShowWindChill=&quot;False&quot;\n                ShowWindSpeedAndDirection=&quot;true&quot;\n                TodayIconSize=&quot;Large&quot; /&gt;\n</pre><br /><br />Please consider making a PayPal donation to mjhufford@gmail.com.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif\" /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
