I was trying to use textfiles for that, but as they grew bigger and bigger I was getting more and more frustrated.\r\n I saw a great tool called Leo (<a href=\"http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html\">http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html</a>) and it inspired me to create a simple tool for myself.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmEdit is a simple note (plain text) taking application that organizes notes in a form of a tree.<br>\r\nmEdit is not an alternative to Evernote or OneNote - it's much simpler, doesn't have any capabilities of saving data to the cloud, doesn't support any kind of attachments etc. Think of mEdit as a 'notepad &#43; treeview'. That's really it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://download.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=medit&DownloadId=318572\" alt=\"mEdit\" width=\"817\" height=\"462\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\r\n<p>mEdit originally required .net Framework 2.0 to be installed on the machine. Recently I've converted the solution to VS 2010 and in the nearest future I plan to migrate from .net Framework 2.0 to 3.x (or even 4).</p>\r\n<p>Please note, that this requirement may change in the nearest future, as I am planning to use Linq2XML.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>mEdit also uses:</strong><br>\r\n- managed wrapper to Scintilla text editor control - ScintillaNet (<a href=\"http://scintillanet.codeplex.com/\">http://scintillanet.codeplex.com/</a>)</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
