Primary goal is to run commands in a way to send a request and checking the answer. It is not primarily meant as basis for a normal telnet client, but more for running batch jobs via telnet.<br /><br />The code has been frequently downloaded from my homepage. <b>Since this was my 1st C# program ever (V0.74 as of 3-2005), and due to the lack of time, I can not support it any more</b>. Actually there have been no fixes since years. I have migrated the client now to this web site in order to give other developers the chance to improve the code and share it with others. <br /><br />Some thoughts:\n<ul><li>I would be glad if somebody would like to <b>take over the role of the coordinator</b>. Basically I want to donate the code.</li>\n<li>We would need some <b>free telnet test accounts</b> in order to further develop the application,e.g. for unit tests and demos.</li>\n<li>As said, the original code is &gt;6 years old and <b>definitely needs refactoring</b>.  </li></ul>\n<br />See: <a href=\"https://telnetcsharp.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Examples&referringTitle=Home\">Examples</a> | <a href=\"https://telnetcsharp.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Troubleshooting&referringTitle=Home\">Troubleshooting</a> | <a href=\"https://telnetcsharp.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=References&referringTitle=Home\">References</a> | <a href=\"https://telnetcsharp.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Development&referringTitle=Home\">Development</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
