Includes a level editor, a GUI controls library and a sample RTS game, Factions. Contains A&#42; pathfinding for unit movement and an ants system for AI navigation.<br /><br />The DEngine requires XNA 3.0 Runtime: <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6521d889-5414-49b8-ab32-e3fff05a4c50&amp;displaylang=en\">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6521d889-5414-49b8-ab32-e3fff05a4c50&amp;displaylang=en</a><br />and the .NET 3.5 Framework: <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ab99342f-5d1a-413d-8319-81da479ab0d7&amp;displaylang=en\">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ab99342f-5d1a-413d-8319-81da479ab0d7&amp;displaylang=en</a><br />You will also need to install the fonts Miramonte and Miramonte Bold from the XNA Redistributable Fonts pack: <a href=\"http://creators.xna.com/en-GB/contentpack/fontpack\">http://creators.xna.com/en-GB/contentpack/fontpack</a><br />These fonts are also included with the compiled binary, in the file &quot;RedistributableTTFs.zip&quot;.<br /><br /><b>Documentation</b><br />The <a href=\"https://dengine.codeplex.com/documentation?referringTitle=Home\">Documentation</a> will give you an idea how to use the DEngine to make your own 2D game.<br /><br /><br /><b>DEngine Overview</b><br /><br />The DEngine is a 2D engine work-in-progress that includes physics simulation and a level editor for Windows.<br /><br />There are three projects in the Visual Studio solution:<br />\n<ul><li>DEngine - Class library which contains the guts of the code. Implements a quad tree, a scenegraph, and several GUI objects.</li>\n<li>DEditor - A Windows Forms application for creating and editing XML-formatted level files for the DEngine.</li>\n<li>FactionsGame - A sample working strategy game using the DEngine.</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/DEngine/6f4f3620-34d6-41cc-b930-0c661803aa17\" alt=\"DEditor.png\" title=\"DEditor.png\" /><br /><i>The DEditor main window.</i><br /><br />The DEngine uses Tiles, Actors and Backgrounds to make up a game world. These are defined using images and XML files as can be seen in the sample game, Factions.<br />When you place terrain tiles in the DEditor, surrounding terrain will be altered to form seamless terrain edges. These &quot;transition tiles&quot; are defined in XML also.<br /><br />Read the full <a href=\"https://dengine.codeplex.com/documentation?referringTitle=Home\">Documentation</a> for more info.<br /><br />The DEngine also includes a set of GUI objects that you can use in your game, they are within the DEngine.DGui namespace within DEngine. You can see a few GUI elements in the screenshots below.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/DEngine/986b80b6-351f-4249-95a8-347c6a3e47f2\" alt=\"FactionsMenu2.png\" title=\"FactionsMenu2.png\" /><br /><i>Factions main menu.</i><br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/DEngine/87d25f82-f7f6-453b-bc09-6819bbf869d7\" alt=\"FactionsMenu.png\" title=\"FactionsMenu.png\" /><br /><i>The New Skirmish Game menu for Factions.</i><br /><br />The <b>Factions</b> game includes robust multi-unit pathfinding code, an ants system for enemy attack planning, a minimap, and is capable of playing large maps of 250x250 tiles or even more.<br /><br />The gameplay is currently a little lacking in functionality. So, you can&#39;t yet build units. But units placed on the game board can be moved and commanded to fight with enemy units. The enemy will also attack you.<br /><br />Controls:<br />\n<ul><li>Left Mouse - Select unit(s)</li>\n<li>Right Mouse - Move or attack with selected units</li>\n<li>Ctrl+A - Select all units</li>\n<li>M - Move mode for selected units (Left-click to issue move location)</li>\n<li>A - Attack mode for selected units (Left-click to issue attack target)</li>\n<li>S - Stop movement for selected units</li></ul>\n<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/DEngine/24f27fa4-83c5-4727-a957-63fc0e22f392\" alt=\"FactionsInGame.png\" title=\"FactionsInGame.png\" /><br /><i>In-game screenshot of Factions.</i><br /><br /><br /><br />Hopefully people may find useful code in here to use in their own game. Hack it apart as you wish!<br /><br /><b>Outstanding Issues / Future Work</b><br /><br />There are numerous issues with this code as it currently stands.<br />\n<ul><li>There is still a situation in which a transition tile is not added correctly to an interior corner.</li>\n<li>XML data for levels, actors, and tile transitions are not compiled with the XNA content processor. This is not a big deal but allows the user to modify game data which will become a problem when multiplayer code is written.</li>\n<li>General code cleanup is required.</li></ul>\n<br /><b>Thanks to:</b><br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=8856.\">http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=8856.</a> - DBB for his awesome Mecha Construction kit I&#39;ve used in Factions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html\">http://lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html</a> - Danc&#39;s Miraculously Flexible Game Prototyping Tiles for the bush graphic used in Factions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/FarseerPhysics\">http://www.codeplex.com/FarseerPhysics</a> - The Farseer Physics engine which handles all the physical simulation in the DEngine.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=130&amp;rowstart=0\">http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=130&amp;rowstart=0</a> - mdx4ever for his SceneGraph tutorial.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article934.asp\">http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article934.asp</a> - Gamedev for their excellent article which I drew upon for the terrain transitions.</li></ul></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
