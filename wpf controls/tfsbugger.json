This app will (eventually) get rid of the irritating need to always manually refresh your work item list, and will notify you when any relevant check-ins have been performed (as well as the results of the CI builds those check-ins launch).  <br /><br />This project is still in the extremely early incubator phase, and is obviously not close to being ready for primetime.  </div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
