I've done minimal cleanup, and the code isn't perfect (and there are few comments) and I have to testify that I was inspired by a similar component that I found here on CodePlex.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'd really appreciate any feedback on whether you think the project isn't feasible, whether you'd like to use it if it were more mature, and that sort of thing.
