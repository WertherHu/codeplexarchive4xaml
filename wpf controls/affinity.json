In other words, it allows a developer to define each property as an expression of arbitrary complexity and not have to worry about change tracking, as the framework\r\n raises a property change notification automatically each time&nbsp;the expression output value changes. It&nbsp;accomplishes this by maintaining state for the entire expression tree and intelligently listening for property and collection change notifications\r\n on referenced objects and recalculating parts of the expression tree as appropriate.</p>\r\n<h2>Flux</h2>\r\n<p>Flux is a flow-oriented Inversion of Control (IoC) system that binds members to members. It blends IoC semantics with C# member semantics. Events are bound to methods, and properties are bound to other properties. Control &quot;flows&quot; out from an event into methods\r\n (event handlers) and data &quot;flows&quot; out from properties into other properties.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Target Platforms</h4>\r\n<p>Affinity consists of Portable Class Libraries targeting</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>.NET Framework 4.5 (including WPF) </li><li>Silverlight 5 </li><li>Windows 8 </li><li>Windows Phone 8.1 </li><li>Windows Phone Silverlight 8 </li><li>Xamarin.Android </li><li>Xamarin.iOS </li><li>Xamarin.iOS (Classic) </li></ul>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<sub>Keywords:</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- Inversion of Control</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- Dependency Injection</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- .NET</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- C#</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- INotifyCollectionChanged</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- INotifyPropertyChanged</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- WPF</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- Xamarin</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- Mono</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- Silverlight</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- Windows Phone</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- Binding</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- Bindings</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- XAML</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- MVVM</sub><br>\r\n<sub>- ComponentModel</sub></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
