  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\"><h2>Overview:</h2>\rPush Framework is an open source C++ library for high-performance server development. The design is ideal for the scenarios where a large number of connected clients are engaging in real time.<br />Beside handling the standard request-response workflow, the library is also designed to stream data (broadcast data) to large groups of connected clients maintaining overall efficiency and rules of QoS specific to each broadcast queue.<br /><br />You can monitor the real time activity of your PF-powered server using a Deploy-only Dashboard. It will show detailed metrics about visitors, bandwidth, processing (throughput) and broadcast QoS, which would allow you to optimize and tackle performance problems with great comprehension.<br /><br />There is a dedicated website at your disposal to learn more and download complete examples around this library : <a href=\"http://www.pushframework.com\">http://www.pushframework.com</a><br /><br /><b>As of February 1st 2013, a <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/536254/Server-Wizard\">Visual C++ Custom Wizard</a> is available to easily create a PF-based server project, by generating all code for you</b><br /><br /><b>January 14th 2014: <a href=\"http://www.chesscomposer.com\">Chess Composer</a></b>, a client server chess application for real time blitz play is online ! The server part of this application is based on Push Framework.<br /><div style=\"clear:both;height:0;\">&nbsp;</div><img style=\"float:right;padding-left:.5em;\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5sK5LKdcP34/TCZCyO3bCtI/AAAAAAAAAcI/KX7MoP08Gvw/pushframeworkWebsite.jpg\" />\n<h2>Links:</h2>\r<ul><li> <a href=\"http://www.pushframework.com/?page_id=368\">Technical Architecture</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.pushframework.com/?page_id=446\">Developer Guide</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.pushframework.com/?page_id=381\">Tutorials and Protocol Examples</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/PushFramework.aspx\">Article at Code Project</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.pushframework.com/?page_id=387\">Professional Use case</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pushframework.com/?page_id=437\">Bursting the library</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pushframework.com/?page_id=435\">Quality of Service (QoS)</a></li></ul>\n\n<h2>Custom Development:</h2>\rIf you are convinced of the benefit to use Push Framework in your application, and if you lack the development work force then you can ask for development service.
