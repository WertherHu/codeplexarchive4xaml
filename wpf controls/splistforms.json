There you can register custom form controls (stored in library &quot;List Form Controls&quot;) on List Content Types.<br /><br />This controls can be edited with SharePoint Designer or any other Editor using mapped network drives in Windows. <br /><br />It supports a simple template mechanism: Templates are used to create new forms on the fly. <br /><br />Some templates enable you to use jQuery in such forms.<br /><br /><i>This project is <b>alpha</b>.
