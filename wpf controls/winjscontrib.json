It will walk you through the features available and you will be able to have a glimpse at the source code.</p>\r\n<p>The next step is to go to the sources on codeplex, and to download them. The sources is actually the very same application that you could download from the store and much more.</p>\r\n<h1>You could&nbsp; also <a href=\"http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=winjscontrib\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nlook for WinJSContrib in NuGet</a>, or have a look at the <a href=\"/documentation\">\r\ndocumentation</a>.</h1>\r\n<p>The library works equally well on Windows and Windows Phone, and some parts have even been (quite happily) tested on Android devices through Cordova. and the wonderful\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn722381.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Multi-Device Hybrid Apps extension for Visual Studio</a>.</p>\r\n<h1>What can I do with WinJS Contrib ?</h1>\r\n<p><strong>The library contains the following elements :</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a replacement for the default &quot;navigator.js&quot; provided in WinJS project templates\r\n</li><li>a boilerplate custom control </li><li>a&nbsp;control for managing listview layout in your markup </li><li>extended splash screen control </li><li>progress indicator control </li><li>semantic zoom wrapper control </li><li>hub control with multipass rendering </li><li>grid control with multipass rendering </li><li>tab control </li><li>childviewflyout control </li><li>a&nbsp;control for wrapping listviews with grouping and semantic zoom </li><li>a control for flyout page in Windows Phone 8.1 </li></ul>\r\n<p><strong>BINDINGS</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>parameterized bindings </li><li>show / hide </li><li>enable / disable </li><li>Images and background-images </li><li>date formatting </li><li>two way binding </li></ul>\r\n<p><strong>HELPERS</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a set of utility methods </li><li>EventTracker (manage event listeners release) </li><li>a&nbsp;search engine (full javascript !), with multi-threaded search and indexing\r\n</li><li>wrapper for background tasks </li><li>wrapper for contact API </li><li>wrapper for multi-views </li></ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Download the app or the sources and run the project to see many of those&nbsp;features in action.</p>\r\n<p>We welcome contributions if you would like. For the moment, we will do it the old-fashion way on codeplex. If the project gains community momentum, we may move the sources on github.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
