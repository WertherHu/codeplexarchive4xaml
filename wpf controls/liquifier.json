  "Description": "Liquifier is a serialisation/deserialisation library for preserving object graphs with references intact.\r\nLiquifier uses attributes and interfaces to allow the user to control how a type is serialised - the aim is to free the user from having to write code to serialise and deserialise objects, especially large or complex graphs in which this is a significant undertaking.",

To start using the library right away, download the latest release from the Downloads page. Get the source code and look at the unit tests\r\n for examples if the current documentation does not explain what you need, and if that fails, ask on the forum.</span></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
