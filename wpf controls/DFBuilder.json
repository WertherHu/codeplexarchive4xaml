It’s entirely written in Visual Basic 2005. It was created by some people who are Team Members of the Italian .NET community called Visual Basic Tips & Tricks (http://www.visual-basic.it): \n•\tAlessandro Del Sole (Project coordinator and programmer in chief);\n•\tDiego Cattaruzza (Project programmer and tester);\n•\tSergio Pappalardo (Project tester and creator of the CyberInstaller Suite which is featured for the deployment)\n\nOur community is officially recognized by MSDN, so we would be very proud if you come and visit us!\nDeltaForth File Builder is an open-source project, which comes with full source code. It makes use of the ICSharpCode.TextEditor control by the ICSharpCode team. This control is released under the Gnu LGPL license, therefore DeltaForth File Builder is released under the Gnu GPL license (which is LGPL-compliant). Full source code for ICSharpCode.TextEditor is provided with the Builder.\n\nDeltaForth File Builder’s source code implements a particular class library called DeltaForthFileBuilder.CompilerServices which provides managed access to the DeltaForth compiler. This class library is accompanied by a compiled help file which lets you learn how to use it in your own applications.\n",
