I will update the library as soon as I can think of any new useful idea. I&#39;m also open for suggestions <br /><br />Latest release includes:<br />- path finding<br />- collision detection<br />- geometry functions (angles between two points, distance between two points)<br />- progressbar-form for easy displaying progress<br />- double buffered panel to avoid flickering when redrawing<br />- dynamic compiler to execute code on the fly<br />- get all currently pressed keys, no need for focus on form/control or application itself<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
