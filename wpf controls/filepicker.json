The Remote Filepicker overcomes exactly that limitation.\n\nThis user control allows developers to easily embed client-server file-picking functionality into your own application:\n\n=> Displays a server's files and folders on a client\n=> Three modes of operation:\n      -> OpenFile: Browse the server's filesystem and select a file\n      -> OpenFolder: Browse the server's folders and select one\n      -> SaveFile: Navigate to a folder on the server and type in a filename\n=> Multi-Language user interface: English and German currently available. Additional translations on request.\n=> Security: The view of the remote server can be limited to a certain directory and its subdirectories, so that users cannot stumble upon confidential files on the server.\n=> Filetype filter: Display only files with a given ending (e.g. only show XML files)\n=> Uses the platforms native file- and folder-icons. Those are queried on the client-side, thus do not have to be transferred through the network.\n=> Customizable caption: Seemless integration into your application\n=> Lightweight and very easy to use\n=> Compatible with every .NET application and every OS that runs .NET applications. Tested on:\n      -> Windows 2000\n      -> Windows XP\n      -> Windows Vista\n\n=> Chose files and folders from anywhere on any server.\n=> Embed network file chosing capabilities into your own application with close to zero effort!",
