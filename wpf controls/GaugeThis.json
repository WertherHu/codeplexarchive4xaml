This particular progress bar control utilizes various GDI drawing techniques. It is developed in VB.NET.<br /><br />The GaugeThis Progress Bar uses the DrawBorder3D method of the Grapics object to allow the standard control boder styles, as well as some custom styles and a rounded-corner bitmap background.  It is fully GDI drawn, and it has many features that are lacking in the .NET common controls version, including:\n<ul><li>Ability to overlay text, value, and completion percentage</li>\n<li>Ability to control gradient pattern and colors</li>\n<li>Ability to control segment and gap width</li>\n<li>Ability to control background color (except with rounded corners... coming soon), forecolor, font, etc.</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/GaugeThis/340eeeb6-b431-49f5-94fa-d9279719a2cf\" alt=\"samples.png\" title=\"samples.png\" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
