However, tfc.exe will still continue to work against the new TFS urls.</b><br /><br />The CodePlex Client is not currently being maintained. The focus of the CodePlex team now is on the <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/SvnBridge\">SvnBridge</a> project (based on <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7082\">overwhelming user feedback</a>). The CodePlex Client will continue to work going forward, and we&#39;ll do our best to answer any questions, but unless there is a serious security bug, please don&#39;t expect any further releases.<br />\n<h2>What is the CodePlex Source Control Client?</h2>\rThe CodePlex Client is a command line source control client for CodePlex users. It supports working fully offline in a traditional edit-merge-commit style. It requires .NET 2.0.<br /><br />The release ZIP file includes two executables: cpc.exe and tfc.exe.\n<ul><li><b>cpc.exe</b> can be used to talk to the CodePlex source control servers, and has a CodePlex project-based command line. It hides the fact that there are multiple TFS servers. It allows users to enter their CodePlex username &amp; password rather than having to know their domain credentials. Finally, it supports the anonymous access features of CodePlex TFS servers for non-coordinator/developer access.</li>\n<li><b>tfc.exe</b> can be used to talk to any TFS server, and has a TFS url-based command line. It supports automatic authentication with your currently logged in credentials.</li></ul>\n<h4>Common Help Topics</h4>\r<ul><li><a href=\"https://codeplexclient.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Installation&referringTitle=Home\">Installation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codeplexclient.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Workflow&referringTitle=Home\">Typical workflow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codeplexclient.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ConfigFile&referringTitle=Home\">Configuration</a></li></ul>\n<h4>Community contributions to projects</h4>\r<ul><li><a href=\"https://codeplexclient.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=HowToContribute&referringTitle=Home\">How to contribute to an Open Source project on CodePlex</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codeplexclient.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=HowToAcceptContributions&referringTitle=Home\">How to accept contributions to your CodePlex project</a></li></ul>\n<h4>Download</h4>\r<ul><li><a href=\"https://codeplexclient.codeplex.com/releases/view/28838\">CodePlex Client June 2009 Release</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
