This feature makes it easier to focus on your algorithms and makes the code more easy to maintain. It also makes it possible to mock tests, override base implementations and configure/customize for different environments and customers.<br /><br />As .NET (and Java and so on...) developers we are used to these kind of patterns but this is not common in the SQL world. QIC brings the power to SQL Server.\n<h2>THE FUTURE OF QIC</h2>\rQIC contains a core set of functions, but there are more things that I&#39;m aiming for. I think there are many patterns and use cases where QIC could add value. The <b><a href=\"https://qic.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic\">ISSUES LIST</a></b> contains a list of these features. <br />If you want to contribute to the development, please contact me on twitter.\n<h5>MERCHANDISE</h5>\rDo you want unique accessories? I&#39;m creating some QIC branded things and they will be available for sale at redbubble.com.\n<ul><li><b><a href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/tjorw/works/11781382-qic-depends\">QIC - DEPENDS</a></b> INJECT SAFE - YOUR DATABASE DEPENDS ON IT</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/tjorw/works/11782484-qic-sql-writes-blue\">QIC - SQL WRITES (BLUE)</a></b> INJECT &amp; SERVE - SQL WRITES SINCE 2014</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/tjorw/works/11782614-qic-sql-writes-white\">QIC - SQL WRITES (WHITE)</a></b> INJECT &amp; SERVE - SQL WRITES SINCE 2014</li></ul>\n<h5>MY TWITTER</h5>\rMy twitter account can be found at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/modermodemet\">@modermodemet</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
