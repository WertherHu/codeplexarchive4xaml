Clients requirements were two forms with a lot of business rules/calculations which would be available to the public; a secure logon and input table and backing database to put data which would be used for certain calculations; the user form needed to provide feedback on calculations as they typed (ajax/Json). I built this project out in approximately 70 hours all in (including data entry, meetings and other non-coding tasks) <br><br>Why I put this project out here was to demonstrate various tools, patterns and techniques that might help you get your arms around MVC.<br><br>Some of those things include:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Passing complex object graphs and having the default ModelBinder properly map them</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Using nested UI hints to promote uniformity and code re-use</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Using Automapper to wire up dependancies on the ViewModel pattern</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Using StructureMap to enforce classes are only accessed via interfaces</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Writing small, terse functions in such a way that a subject matter expert could perform a code review</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Unit tests on all calculations</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Using Ajax/JSon</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>JQuery &amp; CSS manipulation</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>ASP.NET Membership Provider</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Telerik Grid control</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div class=wikidoc>Caching&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The complex object graph in this example has a Worksheet ViewModel, which contains multiple other nested ViewModels, one of which being a collection:</p>\n<p>Worksheet has-a Family: Family has-a Array of Child : Child has-a Name and DOB</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://kjpd9w.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p0YJlWVRRLQ0tFRf-yeoOnellk1hc_opZyqlfAyh-CrMJY8EQa6xTlr1Io-tRCs8ETnHq9yO2Ry5jPDnb3j_Hs1KOnsybMr2P/ComplexObjectGraph.png?psid=1\" alt=\"Complex object graph \" width=893 height=373></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
