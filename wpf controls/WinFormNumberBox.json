Providing a better user experience over MaskedTextbox when entering numbers.<br />\n<h1>Why</h1>\rI needed a &quot;textbox&quot; to input numerical values. The MaskedTextBox is not user friendly enough for entering numbers, specially money entering is hard for the end-user.<br /><br />These control let the user enter a number, but does at no point allow illegal characters to be entered (or pasted) into the control.<br />\n<h2>What does this mean:</h2>\rThe user cannot enter non-numerical characters into the IntBox/MoneyBox. They are simply ignored. However, if it is legal to enter a decimal or thousand seperator (dot or comma), they are allowed.<br /><br />Also in the MoneyBox the currenty symbol ($ or â‚¬, etc) is allowed, but only on the correct location.<br /><br />I think, this gives the user the best experience.<br />\n<h1>See also</h1>\r<ul><li><a href=\"https://winformnumberbox.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Implementation%20Details&referringTitle=Home\">Implementation Details</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vantslot.be/gertdotnet\">My Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
