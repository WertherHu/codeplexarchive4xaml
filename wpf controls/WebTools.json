Also includes the WebTools.UI library which is a collection of ASP.NET server controls for rollover images and other controls.<br /><br /><b>XQuery</b><br />Microsoft SQL Server 2005 includes support for a column of data type XML, which means you can store XML in a column that can be queried using XPath expressions. The WebTools project includes a class called XQuery that will build a SQL statement that can execute an exist() query on the XML data type column, that executes an XPath expression to compare values. <i>View the TestWeb project to see an example of using the XQuery class to store serialized objects in the XML column.</i><br /><br /><b>NullDataReader</b><br />The WebTools project also includes a NullDataReader and SqlNullDataReader classes that wrap the functionality of IDataReader and allow you use the GetInt23, GetString methods with a column name, such as GetInt32(&quot;myColumn&quot;), and will return a default value if the column is DBNull.<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
