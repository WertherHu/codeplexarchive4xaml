So I decided to create some controls to handle images with Alpha Channel and Alpha Blending, it is what I did, and decided to share it to everybody, and name it AlphaMobileControls.<br /><br />Only a few simple controls are currently available, they are &quot;AlphaControl&quot;:\n<ul><li>AlphaLabel</li>\n<li>AlphaPictureBox</li>\n<li>AlphaImageButton</li></ul>\n<br />They must be contained in a particular container, either an AlphaPanel or an AlphaForm.<br /><br />The Alpha Channel in images in managed by the Imaging API andthe Alpha Blending is managed by the AlphaBlend() SDK function. Here is a great article about theses 2 nice features available since Widows Mobile 5: <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/chrislorton/archive/2006/04/07/570649.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/chrislorton/archive/2006/04/07/570649.aspx</a><br /><br />A nice article has been published on CodeProject by Atanu Mandal: <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/windows/Windows_Mobile_UI.aspx\">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/windows/Windows_Mobile_UI.aspx</a><br /><br />Enjoy :o)</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
