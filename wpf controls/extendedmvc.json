I&#39;m accepting suggestions.)<br /><br />Until now these classes only reproduces the behavior of the original properties with the correction of some known issues (like the extra hidden field when Html.CheckBox() method is used).<br />I now started to add some new methods (like ActionImage, RadioSet etc) and I’m working on a Grid also.<br /><br />I’m trying as much as I can to use TDD and to keep the code as simple as possible. I’m using pieces of code from several projects (all of them open source or free).<br /><br />Please feel free to contribute and send any suggestions and feedbacks.<br />\n<h3><a href=\"https://extendedmvc.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Next%20Steps&referringTitle=Home\">Next Steps</a></h3>\r\n\n<h4>Other related projects in Codeplex:</h4>\r<ul><li><a href=\"http://aspnet.codeplex.com\">ASP.NET</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com\">MVC Contrib</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
