Idea was to design a very simple iPhone style of switch control to use it on android and iPhone applications. You will find the design\r\n very rough in the attached example. but i hope it might be helpful to some extent, and can be extended/enhanced to make it nice and usable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
