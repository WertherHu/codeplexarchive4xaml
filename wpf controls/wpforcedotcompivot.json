On the positive side, I have taken pains to adhere to Microsoft&#39;s stock template for the pivot control as much as possible, as well as to clearly differentiate the Force.com classes. The code is extensively documented. It includes TODO references for how to get up and running with a free Force.com developer environment, connect the Windows Phone app, and add test data.<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
