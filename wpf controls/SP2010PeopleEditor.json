Users may accidentally add large AD groups to SharePoint groups and send notifications to hundreds of people. The administrator may want more control over the security of the people picker control. In some scenario the administrator may want to restrict the user to only select ‘users’ or ‘SharePoint Groups’. This can be achieved by creating a custom people picker control which inherits from SharePoint people editor.<br /><br /><b>Environment</b><br />SharePoint 2010, VS 2010<br /><br /><b>Detailed Description</b><br />Find high level documentation on <a href=\"http://markviky.blogspot.com/2010/09/custom-people-picker-editor-in.html\">http://markviky.blogspot.com/2010/09/custom-people-picker-editor-in.html</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
