  "Title": "Programmer's Distributed Visualization Framework",
  "Description": "This project contains several subprojects, including a turn-key volume renderer with support for editable GLSL shaders and a Photoshop-like layer approach to visualization. Supporting projects include an AssetManager to support light-weight proxy objects across many machines or interface devices. A remotable camera control project that is OpenGL and DirectX independent allows for shared cameras and manipulation of cameras across machines. A rudimentary math library and a collection of GUI controls for visualization are also provided. This project is ongoing research at The Ohio State University.",
