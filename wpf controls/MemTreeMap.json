Often I wished to see how all the memory is spent without checking numbers in Process Explorer. MemTreeMap  uses the Visualisation Components from Microsoft Research to show the memory usage in a practical way.<br />There are a bunch of tools to chek the harddisk usage (WinDirStat, Sequoia, ...), but only one (which name i forgot) for the RAM usage, and that one isn&#39;t free anymore.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/MemTreeMap/7d169165-486f-4cb5-9303-353d1c31d6c9\" alt=\"MemTreeMap.png\" title=\"MemTreeMap.png\" /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
