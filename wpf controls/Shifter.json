It is written in c&#35;.<br /><br />Right now it supports constructor, field, property and method injection. Recently I added Windows Phone 8. Now you can implement dependency injection with Shifter on your Windows 8 phone!<br /><br />I hope you like it.<br /><br />I have a blog where I will publish information.
