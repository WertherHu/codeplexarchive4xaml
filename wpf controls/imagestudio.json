Instead of having to constantly Google different functionality to control your images, why not put in to one common place.<br />\n<h3>Merged with ImageResizer and StudioJS</h3>\r\nThis project has merged with <a href=\"http://imageresizing.net\">ImageResizer</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/nathanaeljones/studiojs\">StudioJS</a>.<br /><br />The latest backwards-compatible version of ImageStudio can be found in <i>Contrib/ImageStudio</i> inside the <a href=\"http://imageresizing.net/download\">full ImageResizer download</a>.<br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for full-control image editing in the browser, <a href=\"http://studio.imageresizing.net/studio.html\">look at this demo of StudioJS in action</a>.<br /><br />Merging permitted us to take advantage of a more complete image library, to ensure continued maintenance, and to reduce code duplication between the projects. This will also allow non-destructive image editing to be used, with the possibility for undo/redo as in Picasa.<br /><br />While merging with the new library may require limited changes to your code, you will gain access to more features, better performance,  and the entire ImageResizer community. <br /><br /><br />ImageStudio is used in projects such as:<br /><b>MeetTheBoss.TV</b> <br /><a href=\"http://www.meettheboss.tv\">http://www.meettheboss.tv</a><br /><br /><b>Emirates Skywards Future Artists</b><br /><a href=\"https://www.ourfutureartists.com\">https://www.ourfutureartists.com</a><br /><br /><b>HubPoint.co.uk</b><br /><a href=\"http://www.hubpoint.co.uk\">http://www.hubpoint.co.uk</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
