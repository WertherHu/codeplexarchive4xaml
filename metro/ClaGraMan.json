I&#39;ve decided to release the source to public so that lots of improvements could me made.<br /><br />Actually, a professor of mine asked me to make a software (<i>which became this one</i>) for him so that he can handle the grades of a bit huge amount of classes he handle every semester.<br /><br />This project has still got some (or a lot) bugs so you may contribute by posting an issue.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
