It&#39;s pretty simple. I just find the images fascinating and I&#39;m so lazy, I wanted to write something so I didn&#39;t have to open my browser to see them. In <a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/releases/view/19819\">0.3</a>, I added the ability to see the special search hint regions and submit your own search. Basically, everything you can do from the main Bing homepage.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/binground/36c70cce-1463-453f-a9a6-74cf728fdc8d\" alt=\"binground-maximized.png\" title=\"binground-maximized.png\" /><br /><i><a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Screenshots&referringTitle=Home\">Screenshot</a> from Oct 16, 2009</i><br /><br />\n<h1>Tomorrow</h1>\rLike I said, all I cared about was seeing the background image, so I don&#39;t have any huge plans. I have thought about saving images locally, but am not sure if the gadget API can do that. Perhaps Silverlight is a good means to that end. Then again, maybe nobody cares. It&#39;s all the same to me, right now. If I get feedback, I&#39;ll add more capabilities. If someone wants to contribute, let me know. Until then, enjoy.<br />\n<h1>Known Issues</h1>\r<ul><li><a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/workitem/8016\">Image Thumb Doesn&#39;t Update</a> -- <i><b>Resolved in <a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/releases/view/19332\">0.2</a></b></i></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/workitem/10024\">Images Not Showing Up</a> -- <i><b>Resolved in <a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/releases/view/27771\">1.2</a></b></i></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/workitem/10025\">Fly-Out Goes Wrong Way</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=workitem%3a10793&referringTitle=Home\">Does not work &#40;since Bing rebrand&#41;</a> -- <i><b>Resolved in <a href=\"https://binground.codeplex.com/releases/view/34531\">2.0</a></b></i></li></ul>\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
