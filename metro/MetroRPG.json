Needs a bunch more of the input boxes, it will need the logic to update the calculated fields etc. The work should all be really easy but there is just a lot of it for one person.<br /><br />I included some GPL fantasy images pulled from Wesnoth (by it is basically impossible to find anything of good quality anywhere else on the net without violating rights; I spent a lot of time looking). I thought it would be nice to put a picture of the character somewhere to give it more personality. Would also come in handy when/if we support multiple character sheets in the app.<br /><br />Happy hacking.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
