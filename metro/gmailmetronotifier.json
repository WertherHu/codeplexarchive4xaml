Please head on to the documentation page to know how to disable this feature. Currently the application does not support saving credentials using encryption mechanisms.<br />\n<h1>Background</h1>\rThis project started as a personal one for covering a requirement: get new mail notifications from Gmail in Windows 8, no matter if I were at desktop or in a metro-style application.<br /><br />Although this is somehow covered by Windows 8 Mail app, its functionality is far behind from what I needed. That is how this project began.<br /><br />I use this project also to do some experiments such as better solution organisation, notification broker system or unit testing... That means that the project is a little bit over-engineered for such a simple task.<br /><br />Anyway, I encourage you to head on to the <a href=\"http://gmailmetronotifier.codeplex.com/SourceControl/BrowseLatest\">Source code</a>, have a look and improve it to meet your own needs.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
