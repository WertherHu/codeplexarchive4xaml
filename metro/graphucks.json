It is shamelessly inspired by WPF/XAML.  It doesn&#39;t look to replace mainstream GUIs, but to enhance them easily.  Right now, it only integrates in with Win8 XAML, but it can easily be made to work with desktop apps and possibly windows 7.<br /><br />This is a huge work in progress.  Nothing is more than 10% complete and nothing is correct :)<br /><br />There&#39;s rendering artifacts (mostly due to IRTs), incorrect layout rules, etc.  But shader effects seem to work well.<br /><br />Animation and bindings up soon...</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
