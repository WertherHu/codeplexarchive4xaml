There were too many issues with custom frame parsing to make it worth while, and the fact that music cut out when the phone slept was a deal breaker for me.  I had a nice UI going, but I never got a good playback experience..<br /><br />Now I&#39;m concentrating on Subsonic for Windows 8 Metro.  The browse UI is coming along.  If I can play the URLs without having to do my own MP3 parsing, I may actually release this as an app.  If it works, I&#39;ll fully morph this project site from WP7 to Metro.<br /><br />Old Info:<br />What is Subsonic for Windows Phone 7?<br />Subsonic for Windows Phone 7 is a client app for Subsonic (see below).  When complete, it will will include (at least) all the functionality of the Subsonic Android App.<br /><br />It is currently under development and is in a very initial stage.  If you are a WP7 developr, I encourage you to contribute or make suggestions.  If you are a good designer and would like to contribute, that would be fantastic.<br /><br />What is Subsonic?<br />Subsonic is a free, web-based media streamer, providing ubiquitous access to your music. Use it to share your music with friends, or to listen to your own music while at work. You can stream to multiple players simultaneously, for instance to one player in your kitchen and another in your living room. <br /><br /> <br />Subsonic is designed to handle very large music collections (hundreds of gigabytes). Although optimized for MP3 streaming, it works for any audio or video format that can stream over HTTP, for instance AAC and OGG. By using transcoder plug-ins, Subsonic supports on-the-fly conversion and streaming of virtually any audio format, including WMA, FLAC, APE, Musepack, WavPack and Shorten. <br /><br />If you have constrained bandwidth, you may set an upper limit for the bitrate of the music streams. Subsonic will then automatically resample the music to a suitable bitrate. <br /><br />In addition to being a streaming media server, Subsonic works very well as a local jukebox. The intuitive web interface, as well as search and index facilities, are optimized for efficient browsing through large media libraries. Subsonic also comes with an integrated Podcast receiver, with many of the same features as you find in iTunes. <br /><a href=\"http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp\">http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
