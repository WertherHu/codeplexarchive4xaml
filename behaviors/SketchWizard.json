  "Title": "SketchWizard: Wizard of Oz Prototyping of Pen-based User Interfaces",
  "Description": "SketchWizard makes Wizard of Oz testing more accessible to designers of intelligent sketching applications. In such applications, the requirements for recognition technology are very dependent on low-level interface design choices. Currently, designers must produce costly high-fidelity prototypes in order to evaluate these design choices, which results in fewer design iterations and lower-quality interfaces. Our method uses common components to prototype sketching systems and allows designers to fake complex behaviors by editing usersâ€™ views on the fly. This speeds up design iterations and allows designers to see the effects of low-level interface design decisions early in the development process.",
