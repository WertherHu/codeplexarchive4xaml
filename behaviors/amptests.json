As such it is useful for compiler providers interested in implementing the\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nativeconcurrency/archive/2012/02/03/c-amp-open-spec-published.aspx\">\r\nC&#43;&#43; AMP open specification</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:9.5pt\">Tests include coverage for the compiler, library, and runtime portions. It is us a small subset of the complete test suite Microsoft used for its implementation of C&#43;&#43; AMP. While this test suite will be updated to\r\n increase its coverage of the C&#43;&#43; AMP open specification, the C&#43;&#43; AMP implementer will need additional testing to verify the complete set of C&#43;&#43; AMP functionality.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Prerequisite Understanding</strong><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a title=\"C&#43;&#43; AMP\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nativeconcurrency/archive/2011/09/13/c-amp-in-a-nutshell.aspx\">C&#43;&#43; AMP</a> is an\r\n<a title=\"open specification\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nativeconcurrency/archive/2012/02/03/c-amp-open-spec-published.aspx\">\r\nopen specification</a>, with an implementation from Microsoft in Visual Studio 2012. &nbsp;This codeplex project, is targeted at compiler implementers interested in adding C&#43;&#43; AMP support on any platform.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Contributions</strong></p>\r\n<p>This project is published to provide a collection of tests that may be used to&nbsp;seed testing efforts against an&nbsp;implementation of&nbsp;the C&#43;&#43; AMP Open Specification.&nbsp; We'd also like to encourage feedback and to attract developers who would\r\n like to contribute to the test suite.&nbsp; If interested, please read the attached docx file:\r\n<a title=\"External Contribution Guidlines\" href=\"http://download.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=ampblas&DownloadId=366338\">\r\nExternal Contribution Guidelines</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your interest in C&#43;&#43; AMP!</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
