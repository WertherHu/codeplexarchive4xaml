Some very rarely used features might not be emulated correctly.<br />Some tiny portions of the BCL (Base Class Library) have been implemented in C++, but the purpose was mostly for the development of unit-tests.<br />When using CrossNet, one must <b>provide some BCL implementation</b> (or at least for the classes / methods used).<br />One can either augment the CrossNet emulation of BCL by using <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/crossnetsystem\">CrossNetSystem</a> (not recommended yet), use Mono&#39;s or write own  implementation.<br /><br />CrossNet can be used where .NET / Mono might not be the best fit:\n<ul><li>The platform is not standard and doesn&#39;t support .NET or Mono.</li>\n<li>JIT cannot be implemented on the platform.</li>\n<li>The platform has some memory constraints.</li>\n<li>Best performance is needed and interpretation is not an option (i.e. Mint or MicroFramework might be too slow).</li>\n<li>A simple code that can be customized and facilitate user&#39;s policy is a plus (memory tracking for example...).</li>\n<li>There is a need for direct interaction with C++ code / compiler.</li>\n<li>The code needs to be easily understandable and maintainable (or could be used to learn how .NET behavior can be emulated).</li></ul>\n<br /><a href=\"https://crossnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Important%20notes%21&referringTitle=Home\">Important notes&#33;</a><br /><br /><b>Please look at the <a href=\"https://crossnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=overview&referringTitle=Home\">overview</a>, there is a lot more information and links there!</b><br /><br /><a href=\"https://crossnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Features%20supported&referringTitle=Home\">Features supported</a><br /><a href=\"https://crossnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Features%20to%20be%20supported%20soon&referringTitle=Home\">Features to be supported soon</a><br /><a href=\"https://crossnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Features%20not%20expected%20to%20be%20supported%20soon&referringTitle=Home\">Features not expected to be supported soon</a><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
