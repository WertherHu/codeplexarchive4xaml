F# has unique language constructs which can make very flexible testing languages.  This project intends to explore those options to create a more intention driven experience.<br /><br />Based off ideas from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/fsunit/\">FsUnit</a> this testing DSL is currently targeting the <a href=\"http://codeplex.com/xunit\">xUnit.net</a> framework with the intention of targeting other frameworks.  <br /><br />Some of the syntax possibilities are the following:<br /><br /><i>Testing equality:</i><br />&quot;foo&quot; |&gt; should equal &quot;foo&quot;<br />&quot;foo&quot; |&gt; should not_equal &quot;bar&quot;<br />null |&gt; should be Null<br />&quot;foo&quot; |&gt; should be NonNull<br />&quot;foobar&quot; |&gt; should contain &quot;foo&quot;<br />&quot;foobar&quot; |&gt; should not_contain &quot;hello&quot;<br /><br /><i>Testing True/False:</i><br />true |&gt; should be True<br />false |&gt; should be False<br /><br /><i>Testing collections:</i><br />[1..10] |&gt; should be NonEmpty<br />[] |&gt; should be Empty<br />[1..10] |&gt; should have 3<br />[1..10] |&gt; should not_have 25<br /><br /><i>Exception Management:</i><br />throwsExceptionFunc |&gt; should (throw_exception&lt;ArgumentException&gt;)<br />doesntThrowException |&gt; should not_throw_exception<br /><br />Future directions include the creation of a Behavior Driven Development experience in the vain of Specter, Specs, MSpec among others using F# language constructs.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
