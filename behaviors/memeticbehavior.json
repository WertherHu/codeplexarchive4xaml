This is an attempt at using the concepts described in the aforementioned toolkit, into a more generic library for .NET.  This is an attempt at creating a C# edition of this brilliant toolkit. It was originally intended to be a WheelMUD-only feature, but it looks to be big enough to warrant its own project.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
