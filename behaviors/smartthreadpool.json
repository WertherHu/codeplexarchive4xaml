  "Description": "Smart Thread Pool is a thread pool written in C#. It is far more advanced than the .NET built-in thread pool.\nHere is a list of the thread pool features:\n\n    * The number of threads dynamically changes according to the workload on the threads in the pool.\n    * Work items can return a value.\n    * A work item can be cancelled.\n    * The caller thread's context is used when the work item is executed (limited).\n    * Usage of minimum number of Win32 event handles, so the handle count of the application won't explode.\n    * The caller can wait for multiple or all the work items to complete.\n    * Work item can have a PostExecute callback, which is called as soon the work item is completed.\n    * The state object, that accompanies the work item, can be disposed automatically.\n    * Work item exceptions are sent back to the caller.\n    * Work items have priority.\n    * Work items group.\n    * The caller can suspend the start of a thread pool and work items group.\n    * Threads have priority. \n    * Can run COM objects that have single threaded apartment. \n    * Support Action<T> and Func<T> delegates.\n    * Support for WindowsCE (limited)\n    * The MaxThreads and MinThreads can be changed at run time.\n    * Cancel behavior is imporved.\n",
