  "Description": "The xOWL Infrastructure brings the Model-Driven Engineering principles to domain experts by enabling them to build, execute and test models through visual notations specific to their domain. Experts from different domains can interact with the same model through different visual notations.\r\n\r\nThe xOWL Infrastructure relies on a common modeling language: xOWL, an extension of the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL2). \r\nThe xOWL language enables the representation of behaviors (as imperative algorithms) and rules within ontologies. In this way, models built by domain experts can be executed and the result presented with domain-specific notations.\r\n\r\nThis project is developed in Java with some bits in C#. Java 7 is required for domain experts to run their domain-specific modeling environment. The .Net framework 2.0 is required for software engineers to build these environments.",
