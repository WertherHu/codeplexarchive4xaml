This is due to the post-back which is occurring and the use of Javascript of the color picker.  Updating/Exiting the settings and going back into the settings will display the iColorPicker options again.\r\n\r\n*NUISANCE* When clicking on the iColorPicker to select a color, if you don't change the color, there isn't a way to close the pop-up box.  Selecting a color will close this box, but clicking outside the box, doesn't.  Looking into changing to a different color picker to resolve this and possibly the above nuiseance.\r\n",
