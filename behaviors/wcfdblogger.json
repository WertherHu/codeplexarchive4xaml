The database format is inspired by Enterprise Logging but more tailermade just for message logging. The centralized feature is correlation between messages.<br /><br /><b>Features</b><br />It&#39;s first goal is to provide sourcecode in environments where there are multiple (WCF)services. It&#39;s possible to log the messages directly to the database or to log the messages via a service. (This is usefull if you also want to have your messagelogtraffic via the ESB.) The suite is also going to be provided with a messagelogviewer based on WCF Dataservices.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
