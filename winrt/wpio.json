Thanks to <b>WP.IO</b> you can now share most of your file manipulation code between Windows Phone and Windows 8 projects, in case you are developing app for both platforms.<br /><br /><b>Available on NuGet</b><br />This library is <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/WP.IO/1.0.0-beta\">available for download on NuGet</a> as a package named <b>WP.IO</b>. Note it&#39;s currently published as &quot;prerelease&quot; package until all unit tests are completed and unlikely initial bugs are found.<br /><br /><b>Feedback wanted</b><br />I&#39;d be grateful, if you take a look on the source code and let me know of any potential issues or possible performance improvements, thanks :)</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
