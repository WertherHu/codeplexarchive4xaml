However, the WinRT API is vastly different from any other .Net subset, so my priority is now to make it work efficiently on Windows RT.<br /><br />I have create a very basic virtual piano keyboard App (available in the source code). At this stage, I&#39;m experiencing dropped notes but I think this is not a problem in the library but just in the way I handle events from the virtual keyboard.<br /><br />During this phase, I&#39;m assessing interest and feedback from the community and evaluating the feature set of the library. <br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
