I’ve kept the namespaces intact ; so its easy to replace with the official Prism framework when it is ready. However, I have renamed the assemblies to avoid any confusion.\r\n\r\nIt uses a MetroIoC  - (port from microIoc  done by Ian Randall) as the only IOC container I could find to work with Metro style apps.  \r\n\r\n",
