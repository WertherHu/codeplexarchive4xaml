The assembly codes in this project can be built with armasm, which is the assember in Visual Studio. <br /><br />The ffmpeg version is 2.4 release.<br /><br />This project is not finished, I can built it but not test. I hope someone can work together with me.<br /><br /><b>Build</b> <br />1. You need to prepare MinGW+MSYS environment. <br />2. Run VS2013 ARM Cross Tools Command Prompt first, and then run the msys from the command tool.<br />3. make sure cl, lib is called from VS,not from MinGW.<br />4. Run build<i>ffmpeg</i>msvc.sh<br /><br /><b>Issues</b><br />This project is not finished, these issues should be fixed.<br />1. The avoided API should be redirected in ffmpeg, like createfile, threads, ect.<br />2. vc1dsp<i>neon.asm , mlpdsp</i>armv6.S not finish. So this ffmpeg doesn&#39;t support vc1 and mlp decode.<br />3. \\libswscale\\arm not finish.<br />4. No network support.<br /><br />Move to github  <a href=\"https://github.com/qyljcy/FFmpeg\">https://github.com/qyljcy/FFmpeg</a><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
