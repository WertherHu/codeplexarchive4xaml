It also converts to and from the homebrew &#39;Vex&#39; format, which is used as an intermediate format. Vex can then generate xaml, and wmf files as well as swf files.<br /><br />Currently supports swf files up to Flash version 8. This is a VS2008 project in C#. Includes Actionscript support (read and write, at the bytecode level). Also has a various side projects - xna experiments, swf to xaml conversion (&quot;The Converted&quot;), a swf dump tool, flasm support, a box2d code generator...<br /><br />!Sub Projects\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://swf.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=theConverted&referringTitle=Home\">theConverted</a> Swf to Xaml Converter</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://swf.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=V2D&referringTitle=Home\">V2D</a> A Box2D Layout Generator</li></ul>\n<br /><br />Created by Robin Debreuil over 2007 and 2008. Future plans include AS3 parsing and generation (which means swf 9 and 10 support), and to link it with the C# parser project (also hosted on codeplex).<br /><br />This has been released under the BSD.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
