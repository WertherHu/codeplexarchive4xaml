Don't want to hassle with pointing it to a physical SMTP server? All you want to is verify it can send email, and take a look at the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapercut is the answer<strong>.</strong> Papercut is a <strong>simplified SMTP server</strong> designed to only receive messages (not to send them on) with a GUI on top of it allowing you to see the messages it receives. It doesn't enforce any restrictions\r\n on addresses, it just takes the message and allows you see it. It is only active while it is running, and if you want it in the background, just minimize it to the system tray. When it receives a new message, a balloon message will show up to let you know.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Features</h2>\r\n<h3>Instant Feedback When New Email Arrives</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.tinygecko.com/downloads/Papercut-v3.1.0-S2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3>Rich and Detailed View of Received Email</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.tinygecko.com/images/Papercut/Papercut-Main.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3>View and Download the Mime Sections of your Email</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.tinygecko.com/images/Papercut/Papercut-Mime.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3>In Version 4 the Raw View Returns</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.tinygecko.com/images/Papercut/Papercut-Raw.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3>New in Version 4.4: Logging View</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.tinygecko.com/images/Papercut/Papercut-Log.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h2>License</h2>\r\n<p>Papercut is Licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">\r\nApache License, Version 2.0</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Contribute</h2>\r\n<p>Papercut source versioning is <strong>Git</strong>.
