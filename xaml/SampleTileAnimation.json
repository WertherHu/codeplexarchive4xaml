We did implement that in the project, I thought of putting this sample in the codeplex so if someone is starting it up, can quickly look through this sample and implement Tile Animation using Storyboard feature.\r\n Wealth of information on this can be found in the MSDN link&nbsp;<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br229564.aspx\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br229564.aspx</a>&nbsp;. This sample would be a quick start for\r\n folks who are starting with Storyboard Animation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
