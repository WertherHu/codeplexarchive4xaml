The ProcessParameters could not be versioned in Source Control, which makes it somehow difficult to manage large and growing builds. <br />Therefore the Build Process Commands have been written: you could simply export and import the <b>build process parameters</b> of a Build Definition and version it under Source Control.<br />In conjunction with the Clone Build Definition command of the TFS Powertools setting up a new build for a new branch gets incredible easy.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/BuildProcessCommands/bfad5f9c-0170-4175-bdd2-39a41921c857\" alt=\"BuildDefinitionCommands.png\" title=\"BuildDefinitionCommands.png\" /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
