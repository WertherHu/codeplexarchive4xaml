Besides, I have a lot of work with my studies, so don&#39;t except any updates.<br /><br />Maybe I have another idea to reduce the overall complexity of such an engine, so I can start to work from scratch. The current state of development will be abandoned anyway.<br /><br />It was planned, that LumenLiquid is an easy to use game engine, which carries all tools needed to make a more or less complex 3D Adventure. The main problem was the complexity it has to cover in order to be a proper engine.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
