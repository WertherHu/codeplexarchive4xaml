  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\">\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Math render for Windows Store is a library that provides on-the-fly rendering of mathematical expressions in XAML based Windows Store applications (Windows 8.1 or newer) using&nbsp;<a href=\"http://microsoft.github.io/Win2D/\" target=\"_blank\">Win2D</a> for\r\n rendering. This is an attempt to port&nbsp;<a href=\"https://launchpad.net/wpf-math\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Regueiro&rsquo;s WPF-Math for .NET Framework 4.0 library</a> to modern Windows Store applications.</p>\r\n<p>The mathematical formulas are written using <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nLaTeX/Mathematics </a>syntax and rendered using Win2D (DirectX) canvas placed in your XAML code.</p>\r\n<p>If you do not know Win2D, see <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015/2-631\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nIntroducing Win2D: DirectX-Powered Drawing in C#</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Status</h3>\r\n<p>I have the basic stuff working, but some features are broken (see warnings in the code). I have ported the solution for a very specific purpose and will focus on development of the features needed for my application. If you are interested in contributing\r\n to the project in general or have some bug fixes, you are very welcome to contact me.</p>\r\n<p>There are no published version, but you will find a <strong>running sample</strong> if you download the source code.</p>\r\n<h3>Here are some samples</h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://baekdorf01.blob.core.windows.net/math4winrt/sample1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"166\"></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://baekdorf01.blob.core.windows.net/math4winrt/sample2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"286\"></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://baekdorf01.blob.core.windows.net/math4winrt/sample3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"532\" height=\"405\"></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
