And especially with images you want to use, but you realize you can&#39;t because they are too static to reflect even the smallest changes.<br />The solution is based on MVC actions and Html helper methods creating images ondemand.<br /><br />Let’s see some example problems and the extension methods that cure the pain.\n<h1>Problems that can be solved with XAMLtoMVC</h1>\rProblem 1. Your web page is designed with glossy buttons that have custom typefaces.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/xamltomvc/0f0f53ac-7e1d-47ea-97fa-369d53c6a879\" alt=\"tacepaosamples.png\" title=\"tacepaosamples.png\" /><br /><b><a href=\"https://xamltomvc.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Tacepao%20methods&referringTitle=Home\">Html.Tacepao&#40;..&#41; solves it.</a></b><br /><br />Problem 2. You&#39;d like to display user-uploaded images on your webpage in a polaroid-like frame with a soft shadow and a watermark on it.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/xamltomvc/ef364c4d-da31-43cc-9875-2da549f9c06f\" alt=\"xamltopngsamples.png\" title=\"xamltopngsamples.png\" /><br /><b><a href=\"https://xamltomvc.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=SqlImage%20methods&referringTitle=Home\">Html.SqlImage&#40;&#8230;&#41; solves it.</a></b><br /><br />Problem 3. You&#39;d like user avatars to look like the Vista logon picture, but also include your user&#39;s rank and an online status bar.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/xamltomvc/ae5cb318-e0a5-4466-8672-7b742004271c\" alt=\"avatar.png\" title=\"avatar.png\" /><br /><b><a href=\"https://xamltomvc.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=XamlToPng%20methods&referringTitle=Home\">Html.XamlToPng&#40;&#8230;&#41; solves it.</a></b> <br /><br />Actually the last extension can solve all three problems alone, but it requires you to know and be able to create your own XAML while the first two extensions do not.<br />\n<h1>How to reach the medicine </h1>\r<div style=\"clear:both;height:0;\">&nbsp;</div><img style=\"float:left;padding-right:.5em;\" src=\"/projects/xamltomvc/66b68468-4f38-4c2f-836f-c78099ac780c\" alt=\"xamltomvcnuget.png\" title=\"xamltomvcnuget.png\" /> You can install it into your MVC project with <b>NuGet</b>. Just select the project node in VisualStudio and in its context menu click the &quot;Add Package Library Reference…&quot; The package id is <b>XAMLtoMVC</b>. <br />After it is installed you should find a XAMLtoMVCDoc.html in your project’s Content/XAMLtoMVC folder. That’s your quickstart.
