I will be adding additional WP7.1 assemblies in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI use a default namespace string for all helper assemblies, making it easier to organize and locate assemblies within projects. Each helper assembly will be marked with the following default namespace: &quot;BenScharbach.WP7.Helpers&quot;, with the actual namespace's\r\n specific name at the end of the default namespace; for example, 'UserData' for this assembly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis helper class currently supports the 'Contacts' section within Windows Phone's user-data model. I plan to support additional user-data models, like 'Tasks' in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helper class also support populating 'Sample' data, which is useful when using the Emulator mode. However, the sample-data only supports populating the ViewModel items, since Window Phone's 'Contact' classes are read-only by design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, this helper class requires use of my other StorageHelper class in order to store XML data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nBen Scharbach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
