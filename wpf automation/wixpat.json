Which bakes in recommended practices for building WIX setup projects by the WIX community.<br /><br /><br /><i>This project has been created in response to the request to create an evolving toolkit that demonstrates the value of the NuPattern tooling platform for developers who want to build installers quickly and easily. <a href=\"http://nupattern.codeplex.com/workitem/71\">Build a WIX Toolkit</a>.</i><br /><br /><br />If you are keen, we would love to transition ownership of this project to someone who can take the lead on moving this project forward. Please contact the current project owner.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
