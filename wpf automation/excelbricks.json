Instead of writing VBA or recording macros you use high level commands entered in a Configuration sheet.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, there is a single command to</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>get data from SQL Server and other Excel workbooks </li><li>add a formula to each row that is not blank </li><li>apply filters </li><li>refresh pivots </li><li>convert formulas to values, etc. </li></ul>\r\n<p>You can also use (and even write your own) external modules for more customized functionality. For example</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>split content from a column across multiple rows </li><li>merge rows by collating data from a column </li><li>extract words that match a pattern from a cell </li><li>extract data from text based files </li><li>generate a presentation from a workbook </li></ul>\r\n<p>ExcelBricks has undergone very many iterations. While this doesn't mean 0 bugs :-), it does ensure a pretty high standard for reliability, error-handling and performance to start off.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
