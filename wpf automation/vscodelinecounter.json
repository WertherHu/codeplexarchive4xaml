Counting the number of lines manually on some of my projects could take well over 10 minutes, besides being error-prone.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family:'Segoe UI'; font-size:18pt!important; font-weight:100\">A Screenshot</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/TbrHrUR.png?1\" alt=\"Screenshot of VS Code Line Counter\" style=\"max-width:100%\"></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
