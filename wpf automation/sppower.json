  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\">A hub for executing SharePoint 2010 Powershell commands. Let the WPF MVVM application remember previous commands, and auto-populate new command arguments.<br />\n<h2>Overview</h2>\r\nThe first purpose of this application was to record the commands used to install/deploy/retract/uninstall wsp solutions via Add-SPSolution/Install-SPSolution/Uninstall-SPSolution/Remove-SPSolution. It was annoying opening the SharePoint Powershell command window and copy/pasting the same commands every second day. This application records commands in a history, so with a simple click, you can re-run previous commands with the same or altered arguements. The length of the history is up to the user, trimmed via the delete functionality.<br />\n<h2>Installation</h2>\r\nDownload release<br />Unzip on SharePoint 2010 server<br />\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\r\nEdit Com.CodePlex.SPPower.exe.config to change:\n<ul><li>the history file location</li>\n<li>the category file location</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Using</h2>\r\nRun Com.CodePlex.SPPower.exe\n<ul><li>expand the tree on the left to choose a category (based on <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee890108.aspx\">MSDN SharePoint 2010 PowerShell reference</a>)</li>\n<li>choose a PowerShell command</li>\n<li>the parameters panel is populated from command metadata</li>\n<li>input non-null parameters</li>\n<li>click Execute</li>\n<li>command output displayed in history panel</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/sppower/c7a8d414-d81b-4cc2-a04b-decad95ff7a4\" alt=\"sppower.jpg\" title=\"sppower.jpg\" /><br />\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\r\n<ul><li>make delete from history work</li>\n<li>handle more parameter types (switches, actions, credentials, arrays)</li>\n<li>securely store parameters in history file</li>\n<li>better PowerShell host for more responsive application when running commands</li>\n<li>allow running of multiple commands</li>\n<li>allow storing of variables between commands</li>\n<li>allow piping</li>\n<li>better colours and layout</li></ul>\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
