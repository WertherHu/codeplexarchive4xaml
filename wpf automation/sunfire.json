This library is pure managed .NET and ready for .NET, MONO, Xamarin, Silverlight.</p>\r\n<p>This rasterizer is based on the <a href=\"http://www.SunFireEngine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nSunFire C# Vector Graphic Engine</a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Screenshot</strong>:</p>\r\n<p>The following screenshot is taken directly from the demo application included in the source-code.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://opensource.thnsolutions.com/sunfire/SunFire_Rasterizer.png\" alt=\"SunFire Vector Graphic Engine's rasterizer screenshot\" width=\"512\" height=\"197\"></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pure managed .NET </li><li>POCO (Plain-Old-C#-Object). This means the library is as portable as possible. It can be included in Microsoft .NET, MONO, SILVERLIGHT and XAMARIN. (note: the demo depends on GDI&#43; and Windows Forms, but the main library itself does not)\r\n</li><li>Sub-pixel accuracy anti-aliasing, producing pixel-perfect vector graphics. </li><li>True transparency. </li><li>Simple and intuitive API. </li><li>Uniform, linear gradient, and radial gradient fill. </li><li>Even-odd and Non-zero filling rule. </li><li>Affine transformation (scale, translate, rotate, skew) with stack-based matrix operations.\r\n</li><li>Vector-based clipping mask. </li><li>Gamma correction </li><li>Fast, direct-access pixel buffer. (This means pixel processing does not have to work around unmanaged hacks)\r\n</li><li>No need to constantly release resources. There is absolutely no unmanaged resource is involved. One can draw as much as needed and do not have to remember to dispose anything.\r\n</li><li>Picture-in-picture: one pixel buffer can have many logical views. </li></ul>\r\n<p style=\"color:#253340; font-size:13px; font-family:'Segoe UI',Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; background-color:transparent\">\r\n<strong style=\"background-color:transparent\">History</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"color:#253340; font-size:13px; font-family:'Segoe UI',Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; background-color:transparent\">\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.SunFireEngine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SunFire C# Vector Graphic Engine</a>&nbsp;has been developed since 2005 by\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thnsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#2e8bcc; background-color:transparent\">\r\nTHN Solutions LLC</a>&nbsp;and designed by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.minh-hai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">software architect Nguyễn, M.
