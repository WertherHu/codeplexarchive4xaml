Using DLR Pad you can define a sample UI using XAML and then script against it using IronPython or IronRuby. DLR Pad is ideal for rapid testing of some functionality or for early experimental and proof-of-concept applications. \nDLR Pad features Xaml Pad like functionalities plus Dynamic Language Runtime support (currently only IronPython and IronRuby are implemented) for writing code against the defined XAML. Simple IntelliSense is provided as well.",
