  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\">\r\n<p><strong>Project Description</strong><br>\r\nA Soundtracker Module music player in C# (100% Managed, without interops), At the beginning, a simple port in C# of the famous Mikmod Library. Today, it has some improvements. Three versions are avaible : NAudio Output, Silverlight and XNA (Windows Phone 7,\r\n Windows and Xbox360).The code is shared by links between projects from a trunk &quot;Core&quot; Project. Audio renderers are saved in each project files (Windows, Silverlight and XNA)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilverLight Screenshot :<br>\r\n<img src=\"http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=sharpmod&DownloadId=242851\" alt=\"\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinforms Screenshot :<br>\r\n<img src=\"http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=sharpmod&DownloadId=242854\" alt=\"\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommand line, with track view and position<br>\r\n<img src=\"http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=sharpmod&DownloadId=242856\" alt=\"\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Project's Goal</strong><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis library allow you to add soundtracker music replay to your .NET applications. It's designed for framework 3.5 and 4.0.<br>\r\nActually, Protracker, FastTracker ans ScreamTracker formats are implemented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 Lines of code to do this :</p>\r\n<pre>SongModule myMod = ModuleLoader.Instance.LoadModule(&quot;SongModule.Mod|S3M|XM&quot;);\nModulePlayer player= new ModulePlayer(myMod);\n\n// Silverlight Driver\nSharpMod.SoundRenderer.SilverlightDriver drv = new SharpMod.SoundRenderer.SilverlightDriver(MyMediaElement);\n// Or NAudio Driver\nSharpMod.SoundRenderer.NAudioWaveChannelDriver drv = new SharpMod.SoundRenderer.NAudioWaveChannelDriver(NAudioWaveChannelDriver.Output.WaveOut);\n// Or XNA Driver\nSharpMod.SoundRenderer.XnaSoundRenderer drv = new XnaSoundRenderer(new DynamicSoundEffectInstance(48000, AudioChannels.Stereo));\n\nplayer.RegisterRenderer(drv);\nplayer.Start();\n\n</pre>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Where can I found a Song Module ???</strong><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn you're Amiga old floppies or.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mod Archive <a href=\"http://www.modarchive.org\">http://www.modarchive.org</a><br>\r\nAmiga Music Preservation : <a href=\"http://amp.dascene.net/home.php\">http://amp.dascene.net/home.php</a><br>\r\nand many other ways :o)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Performance</strong><br>\r\n-The replay routine take between 1% and 18% Cpu depending of module played on my PM1.5Ghz centrino laptop.<br>\r\n-Better on my E6300 1.8Ghz desktop.<br>\r\n-Seems to have minor problems on my wife's N270 1.6 netbook (have to test again). Have tested, it's the FFT and visualizers who are too expensive.<br>\r\n-Seems to play fine with the WP7 Emulator. I Need some help to test on real WP7 Hardware.<br>\r\n-Take a maximum of 5% on my new I5-2537 Alienware M11X on complex Module (32 chans with lots of effects and big samples)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Known issues</strong><br>\r\nThe Naudio version will hang up on 64 bits systems (error while loading the NAudio assembly). I'll try to fix it with a modified version of NAudio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>29/05/2011.. first XNA's renderer work</strong><br>\r\n- Thx to the DynamicSoundEffectInstance class... the first attempt to play Mod on WP7 is successful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>23/07/2011 All Xna Platforms are are ok</strong><br>\r\n-See the source code, release will be coming soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>07/11/2011 Welcome to a new developer</strong><br>\r\n- Since the november 4th, Waldog78 will contribute to the project with me.I Hope that we can deliver a new release as soon as possible, including the full XNA binaries and samples for all platfroms and major fixes of the issues.<br>\r\n- The VS2008 solutions will be obsolete, all code will be maintened under VS2010. The target Platforms are .NET 3.5, Silverlight 4 and XNA 4.0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe XNA sound renderer is present in the svn source code. Not yet avaiable as stable release.</p>\r\n<p><strong>14/09/2012 SharpMod is still alive</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>- A Major release will be coming soon, stay tuned</p>\r\n<p>- Enjoy the new SharpMod Logo :)</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>Donate</strong><br>\r\nSharpMod is a free open source project that is developed in personal time.
