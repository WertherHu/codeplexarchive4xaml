It has features to group similar events together, give graphical view of distribution of events over time and in similarity. It is developed in C&#35; and WPF and uses MVVM framework.<br />\n<h1>How to Use the Tool</h1>\r<ul><li>Get the event logs from machine which you want to analyze\n<ul><li>To get event logs, open Event Viewer (eventvwr) on the machine</li>\n<li>Right on the Event name in left pane and select <b>Save All Events As...</b></li>\n<li>Save the events as an Xml file in an empty directory</li></ul></li>\n<li>You can save multiple event files in the folder that you want to analyze</li>\n<li>Open the Event Log Analyzer tool</li>\n<li>Provide the log files folder path at top and click on the <b>Analyze</b> button</li>\n<li>The tool will show a graph of the event logs distribution at the bottom and the event file names on left panel</li>\n<li>To see logs related to a common issue\n<ul><li>Select radio button Sort X axis by -&gt; <b>Occurence</b> at the bottom of the graph </li>\n<li>The graph will show a yellow bar for a group of event log which are related to a common issue</li>\n<li>If you click on any bar, the actual events will be added under the file names on the left panel</li>\n<li>Selecting any event from the left panel which show its details in right top box</li></ul></li>\n<li>To see logs distributed in date and time\n<ul><li>Select radio button Sort X axis by -&gt; <b>Date</b> at the bottom of the graph </li>\n<li>The graph will show yellow colored bar for each group of event logs which occur on the same date (or in the same hour of a day)</li></ul></li>\n<li>To search for logs with a particular text\n<ul><li>Type the text in the <b>Search</b> box of graph</li>\n<li>The Log groups which contain logs with the given text turn Red</li>\n<li>Select the log group. On the left panel observe that the log containing the text turn Red</li>\n<li>Now you can select the highlighted logs to see details </li></ul></li>\n<li>To drill down into the logs\n<ul><li>Lets say you want to first find out the common logs which have the highest number of occurences and then see the distribution over time</li>\n<li>Select <b>Occurence</b> in the graph</li>\n<li>Right click on any yellow bar that you want to drill down</li>\n<li>Another graph will open over the first one. This graph shows only those logs from selected group in first graph</li>\n<li>Select <b>Date</b> in second graph. The logs are shown distributed in dates</li>\n<li>If you want to now look at logs distribution over time on a particular date, right click again on any bar in the second graph</li>\n<li>A third graph opens over second. Select <b>Date</b> again in that to see logs distributed over time</li>\n<li>Now you can select any group in third graph, see the actual log entries on the left panel, select a log on the left panel and see its details on the details box in top right</li>\n<li>To go back to previous graph, click on the second or first graph again</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<h1>Screenshots</h1>\r\n1 Loading Log xml files for parsing <img src=\"/projects/eventloganalyzer/2d9aae3e-8444-4586-a1f7-7a4c70c02382\" alt=\"1&#32;-&#32;Loading&#32;log&#32;xml.jpg\" title=\"1&#32;-&#32;Loading&#32;log&#32;xml.jpg\" /><br /><br />2 Search <img src=\"/projects/eventloganalyzer/b7b0e3d3-be20-4c21-b36d-38644ea3d7b0\" alt=\"2&#32;-&#32;Search.jpg\" title=\"2&#32;-&#32;Search.jpg\" /><br /><br />3 Drill down on Right click on bar in Graph <img src=\"/projects/eventloganalyzer/b27f099d-3c04-4805-9077-ee8afb4e0201\" alt=\"3&#32;-&#32;Drill&#32;down&#32;on&#32;right&#32;click.jpg\" title=\"3&#32;-&#32;Drill&#32;down&#32;on&#32;right&#32;click.jpg\" /><br /><br />4 Multi level drill down <img src=\"/projects/eventloganalyzer/b60bf8c6-6127-4ac2-99bb-7526fc393838\" alt=\"4&#32;-&#32;multi&#32;step&#32;drill&#32;down.jpg\" title=\"4&#32;-&#32;multi&#32;step&#32;drill&#32;down.jpg\" /><br /><br />\n<h1>Future enhancements</h1>\rThis is only the first draft of the tool. A lot of enhancements will be made in next few days to it to make it more useful<br />Few of the items in pipeline are\n<ul><li>Allow the tool to connect to the event viewer of a machine given the IP address of the machine\n<ul><li>Hence no xml will need to be saved</li>\n<li>This will allow for continuous monitoring of logs</li></ul></li>\n<li>Distribute logs by Level of criticality so that the user can concentrate on Error more than Information logs</li>\n<li>Show trends of logs found over time. This will show common areas of concern which needs to be addressed on priority</li>\n<li>Use multi-threaded UI to make avoid hanging when the Analysis takes time</li>\n<li>Many more...</li></ul>\n<br /><br />Happy coding,<br /> <br />Souvik Basu<br /><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/maratha\">http://www.facebook.com/maratha</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.thebasuz.com\">http://www.thebasuz.com</a><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
