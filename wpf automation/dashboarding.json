There are upwards of nineteen dials, gauges and displays in the library<br /><br /><b>Status</b><br /><br /><i>Latest news</i>: Release <b>008</b> available now. This contains six new dials, the 180 degree dials in north, south, east and west orientations and a 90 degree dial in north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west directions. There are new demonstaration applications which allow you to experiment with functionality and appearance without writing code or markup. The face text visibility, color and format options are now applied to all dials uniformly.<br /><br />The release comes with a help file. Please note there are breaking changes from release 006, for example the Dial180 control is now named<br />Dial180North. Hopefully these changes are not going to cause issues for you.<br /><br />Source code is up to date and back in the Source code tab. The relase format has been moved to MSI to allow the WPF demo app and links to the online silverlight application to be inserted into the program files menu.<br /><br />This will be that last release of this library for Silverlight 2.0, I am moving to Silverlight 3.0 real soon.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think screenshots do justice to animated controls so I&#39;ve put a <b>demo project <a href=\"http://www.david-black.info/release008/Default.aspx\">online</a></b>. <br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/dashboarding/ab48de0e-7c9d-4a66-8c9c-c4ee4bcf6db0\" alt=\"Alternate&#32;Text\" title=\"Alternate&#32;Text\" /><br /><br />The following funcionality is implemented in the current code drop:<br />\n<ul><li>Animated dashboard functionality\n<ul><li>Scrolling LED Matrix display\n<ul><li>Odometer </li>\n<li>Thermometer </li>\n<li>Wall thermometer </li>\n<li>Five star ranking</li>\n<li>Five decade LED VDU Meter </li>\n<li>360 dial</li>\n<li>180 dial in North, South, East and Western orientations</li>\n<li>90 Dial in North-east, North-west, South-east and South-west orientations</li>\n<li>Tick cross boolean </li>\n<li>Round led boolean </li>\n<li>Progress bar </li>\n<li>Diamond slider</li>\n<li>Performance monitor </li>\n<li>16 Segment LED Digit</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li>Controls that accept input as well as displaying values  (<a href=\"http://www.david-black.info/Bashboard/Extras/Bidirection.aspx\">Demo and tutorial available</a>)\n<ul><li>Thermometer\n<ul><li>Wall thermometer</li>\n<li>Five star ranking </li>\n<li>360 dial  </li>\n<li>180 dials</li>\n<li>90 dials </li>\n<li>Progress bar  </li>\n<li>Diamond slider  </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
