PluginManager reads an directory and loads all plugins stored in that directory. <br /><br /><b>Note</b><br />With the upcoming release of Expresison Blend 4 I&#39;ve decided to discontinue this project. The code will stay available, but no forther development will take place. Expression Blend 4 supports MEF, the Managed Extensibility Framework. On my weblog is an article on how to get started developing extensions for Expression Blend 4 using MEF: <a href=\"http://www.timmykokke.com/2010/03/building-extensions-for-expression-blend-4-using-mef/\">http://www.timmykokke.com/2010/03/building-extensions-for-expression-blend-4-using-mef/</a>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\r<ul><li>Place BlendPluginManager.dll inside the root directory of Blend, where the Blend.Exe file is located.</li>\n<li>Add a subdirectory called &quot;AddIns&quot; to this directory. </li>\n<li>From now on run Blend with /addin:BlendPluginManager.dll as a parameter, or create a short-cut with this parameter.</li></ul>\n<br />Now you can add all other plugins to the AddIns directory and they will be automaticly loaded when blend starts.<br />You can view which plugins are loaded by opening the PluginManager window located in the <i>Tools</i> menu of Blend.<br /><br />For example: <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/colorful\">http://www.codeplex.com/colorful</a><br /><br />\n<h2>Future Planning</h2>\r<ul><li>I havn&#39;t done any testing with expression design yet. It would be nice if I got the pluginmanager to work in expression too.</li>\n<li>Easier installation.</li>\n<li>Reloading and rescanning plugins.</li>\n<li>Create some documentation on how to write plugins.</li></ul>\n<br />Your ideas, comments and feedback are welcome!<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
