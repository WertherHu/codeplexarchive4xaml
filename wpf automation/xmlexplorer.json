It has been tested on files as big as 300MB. It allows fast viewing and exploration, copying of formatted XML data, evaluation of XPath expressions, and XSD schema validation.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=7827155\"><img style=\"border:none;\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif\" alt=\"Donate via PayPal\" title=\"Donate via PayPal\" /></a><br /><br />It validates XML documents using XSD Schema (specified in the document), shows a list of validation errors, and double-clicking an error navigates and selects the node.<br /><br />An expression library is included to store and manage commonly-used XPath expressions, much like Bookmarks in FireFox. It supports multiple document tabs, with support for middle-clicking to close tabs, and fully-featured, Visual Studio-style dockable panes.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/xmlexplorer/c77da42e-94fe-4b7a-b8a3-d6eb23d6f63d\" alt=\"XML&#32;Explorer.png\" title=\"XML&#32;Explorer.png\" /><br /><br />XML Explorer does not currently have any edit capabilities.  If you need to edit XML files, I highly recommend the excellent <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/xmlnotepad\">XML Notepad</a>.<br /><br />For more information and a walk-through of the code, see the Code Project article at <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19555/XML-Explorer\">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19555/XML-Explorer</a>.<br /><br />XML Explorer uses <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite\">DockPanel Suite</a>, a docking library for .NET Windows Forms development which mimics Visual Studio .NET.  Many thanks to the contributors of the project!<br /><br /><b>Performance</b><br /><br />I&#39;ve compared the times required to load XML files of varying size.  XML Notepad was used for comparison, since it&#39;s nice enough to provide load times in the status bar.  I realize the comparison isn&#39;t exactly fair, as XML Notepad is an XML editor.  I trust you will find a place in your XML toolbox for both applications, as I have.<br /><br /><table><tr><th> File Size </th><th> XML Notepad </th><th> XML Explorer </th></tr>\n<tr><td> 47.4 MB </td><td> 48.68 seconds </td><td> 4.94 seconds </td></tr>\n<tr><td> 31.3 MB </td><td> 18.46 seconds </td><td> 3.63 seconds </td></tr>\n<tr><td> 30.96 MB </td><td> 16.47 seconds </td><td> 2.89 seconds </td></tr>\n<tr><td> 3.69 MB </td><td> 1.55 seconds </td><td> .32 seconds </td></tr>\n<tr><td> 281 KB </td><td> .35 seconds </td><td> .04 seconds </td></tr></table><br /><br />As you can see, the difference is greatest on extremely large files.  On the more normal sized files, the difference is barely noticeable.<br /><br /><b>Memory</b><br /><br />XML Explorer also makes much more efficient use of RAM, by utilizing XPathDocument (instead of XmlDocument), and by loading the XML document into the display on-demand.<br /><br /><table><tr><th> File Size </th><th> XML Notepad </th><th> XML Explorer </th></tr>\n<tr><td> 47.4 MB </td><td> 563.3 MB RAM </td><td> 126.1 MB RAM </td></tr>\n<tr><td> 31.3 MB </td><td> 322.98 MB RAM </td><td> 73.92 MB RAM </td></tr>\n<tr><td> 3.69 MB </td><td> 51.87 MB RAM </td><td> 14.04 MB RAM </td></tr>\n<tr><td> 281 KB </td><td> 12.87 MB RAM </td><td> 6.85 MB RAM </td></tr></table><br /><br />-Jason Coon</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
