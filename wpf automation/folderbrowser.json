WPF currently does not provide a Folder browser dialog and the only thing near enough is the Microsoft.Win32.OpenFileDialog class in WPF&#39;s PresentationFramework.dll assembly which lets users specify multiple files to open. <br /><br /> <img src=\"/projects/folderbrowser/45ece2c4-98cb-4b44-8da9-5f8df7f47fd5\" alt=\"FolderBrowser.png\" title=\"FolderBrowser.png\" /><br /><br />This project does not use any Windows API, it does require a reference to the Prism Patterns &amp; Practices library<br /> </div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
