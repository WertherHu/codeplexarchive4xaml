Simply deploy your lab just with these scripts and ISO file.<br /><br />This solution is used in Microsoft Premier Workshop for Software Defined Storage.<br /><br />You can also download up-to-date scripts from source code page.<br /><br /><b>Usage: (more info in Documentation tab)</b><br />Right-click and run with PowerShell. (1-Prereq -&gt; 2-CreateParentDisks -&gt; 3-Deploy -&gt; Cleanup (if needed) -&gt; modify variables.ps1 -&gt; 3-Deploy again)<br /><br />You will be prompted for Windows Server 2016 ISO (TP4 and newer only) when running 2-CreateParentDisks. <br /><br />You can now create multiple scenarios if you modify variables.ps1.<br /><br />Simple, S2D works on Windows 10<br />Replica,Shared requires Failover Clustering (svhdx filter driver)<br /><br /><b>Tips:</b><br />You can copy W2016 iso into OS folder and you will not be prompted when running 2-CreateParentDisks. <br />You can copy files in \\tools\\toolsVHD\\. Files will be added into tools.vhdx, that is mounted into the DC during deployment (3-Deploy).<br />If your server is offline, run 1-Prereq somewhere else - it will generate all folders and copy it over. Then run 1-Prereq on server again.<br /><br />Big thanks to Dan C. and Jason O. for their great support...<br /><br />jaromirk MSFT</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
