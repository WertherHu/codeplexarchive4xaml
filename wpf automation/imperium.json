Currently supports two X10 controllers.<br /><br />Several years ago I released an X10 library at <a href=\"http://brian.vallelunga.com/code/x10/\">http://brian.vallelunga.com/code/x10/</a>. Due to heavy demand, I have opened the project and source to the community under the new name, Imperium.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
