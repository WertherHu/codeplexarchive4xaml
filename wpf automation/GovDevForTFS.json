This occurs when someone has 1000 or more requirements.\r\n The database records return in less 2 seconds, the issue is that Reporting Services is generating 150&#43; HTML pages to render the report.&nbsp; I am not a SSRS expert so I need help to figure out how to control this to make it more responsive by not generating\r\n all of those pages. Additionally, I would like to rework the UI a bit and then create linked drill down reports for each of the work item columns. As more WIs are added, the field get really big and distorts the RTM report. I want to do something like show\r\n the last 3-4 WI/CS IDs and hovering to show the set. Then clicking to get a more detailed drill-down report.&nbsp; Thnis is just a thought and I welcome other approaches.\r\n</li><li>I also want to redo the contribution report to add more metrics. </li><li>I need to update the SharePoint Features. I took a dependency on a SharePoint-TFS assembly that was removed between TFS 2010 and 2012. A simple policy redirect assembly will likely take care of it but I would like to refactor to remove the dependency.\r\n</li><li>I want to make the lookup of the TFS URL more robust and have created a bug to fix this on the backlog.\r\n</li><li>There are probably a bunch of little things that I have not gotten feedback on....\r\n</li></ol>\r\n<p>If you are game to contribute, let me know but I will be plugging away at it over the coming weeks/months. If you have feature requests, enhancements, bugs, etc., please post them here on the CodePlex site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project Description</strong><br>\r\nMicrosoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2010 is the collaboration platform at the core of Microsoft&rsquo;s application lifecycle management solution.
