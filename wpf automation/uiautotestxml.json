An XML grammar specifies the actions to run on a given application, and the expected behaviour of the application. The engine then runs the test scenarios and indicates completeness, success or failure.<br /><br /><b>Example of XML grammar</b><br />&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;<br />&lt;scenario&gt;<br />  &lt;application path=&quot;calc.exe&quot;&gt;<br />    &lt;launchWaitTimeout&gt;2000&lt;/launchWaitTimeout&gt;<br />  &lt;/application&gt;<br />  &lt;actions&gt;<br />    &lt;setText target=&quot;403&quot; value=&quot;123&quot;/&gt;<br />    &lt;buttonClick target=&quot;92&quot; waitForAction=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;<br />    &lt;setText target=&quot;403&quot; value=&quot;456&quot;/&gt;<br />    &lt;buttonClick target=&quot;112&quot; waitForAction=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;<br />    &lt;checkText target=&quot;403&quot; value=&quot;579, &quot; errMsg=&quot;The calculator is not working !&quot;/&gt;<br />  &lt;/actions&gt;<br />&lt;/scenario&gt;<br /><br /><b>What it is going to do</b><br />Run the Windows calculator, wait for 2 seconds for it to come up. Send &quot;123&quot; in the control 403 (which is the text area of the calculator), then invoke a click on button +, then send &quot;456&quot; to the text area, and simulate a click on the = button. Finally, it is going to check that the result in the same area is indeed &quot;579, &quot;. If it is not... well, you may have an old Pentium 60, and it will display &quot;The calculator is not working !&quot; instead of OK in the console.<br /><br /><b>What is next?</b><br />I need your input to add some commands and functionnality on this piece of code. There is not much for now : a very limited version of the engine, a small console application to run the tests from the XML files, and a sample application to be tested, in which I put a few different controls, and a change of active form to check that the engine can handle this kind of situation. If you test this on your application, please drop a line : what I need is basically test cases that I have not integrated yet in the project. Thanks in advance.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
