There may be many scripts that most team members don&#39;t even know about. <br /><br />How do you keep all of these handy tools organized and documented so everyone can easily access and use them, and avoid confusion and duplication of effort? With wsubi (pronounced &#39;wasabi&#39;), you can save, manage and run all your scripts under one common project, complete with documentation.<br /><br />To get started, download the latest version and follow the simple <a href=\"https://wsubi.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Setup%20Instructions&referringTitle=Home\">Setup Instructions</a>.\n<hr />\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
