Additional user interface niceties need to be added before it will be in a release state.<br /><br />Comments and suggestions are welcome, as are additions to my small codebase. If you try a release build, I would appreciate any and all feedback and/or constructive criticism. Keep in mind, though, that this is far from a release version of the application.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
