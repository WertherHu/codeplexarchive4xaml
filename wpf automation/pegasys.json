You&nbsp;might think that with modern languages such as Visual Basic or PowerShell that the simple batch script might be extinct, but batch has one unique advantage:\r\n It's universal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery machine from Windows XP to Windows&nbsp;10 can use batch scripts, no additional clients or libraries required. That's why we use batch scripts as the basis for our applications.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatch scripts can be quite useful in a production environment as the simplicity of editing a batch script with Notepad can save the day, compared to having to rebuild, compile or debug a more complicated language.</p>\r\n<p>Update: Windows 10 support is here, very little has changed. Progress has been slow due to a recent drive failure. We have reconstructed as much as we could and continued development. A new NSI facelift is in the works.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
