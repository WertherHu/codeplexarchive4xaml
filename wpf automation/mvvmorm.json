Interactions include insert/update/delete, with FK relationships taken into account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqlite and MS Sql Server are supported. Adding support for more DBMS' should be straightforward as there is a clean interface defining DBMS' modules.</p>\r\n<p>Some key features:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keep collections in order of selection from database as items are added or modified.\r\n</li><li>Lazy retrieval of binary fields for faster UI rendering. This avoids a potential slowdown when storing BLOBs.\r\n</li><li>Each database item record (table, view, or stored procedure) is represented in a distinct partial class. These partial classes serve as Models. ViewModels can be constructed by augmenting the partial classes in separate files. MVVM ORM sources can serve\r\n as an example. </li><li>Automatically add IsSelected and IsExpanded properties when not defined in table, view, or result set from a stored procedure. These can then be bound to the corresponding properties of TreeViewItem, ListBoxItem, etc.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>\r\n<p>I did not have time to create documentation yet. MVVM ORM sources serve as a decent reference implementation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How to download and use</strong></p>\r\n<p>Please see:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mvvmorm.codeplex.com/documentation\">https://mvvmorm.codeplex.com/documentation</a><strong><br>\r\n</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Visual Studio 2010<br>\r\nPRISM 4.1 binaries: <a href=\"/wikipage?title=http%3a%2f%2fwww.microsoft.com%2fen-us%2fdownload%2fdetails.aspx%3fdisplaylang%3den%26id%3d28950&referringTitle=Home\">\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28950</a><br>\r\nLatest version of System.Data.SQLite: <a href=\"/wikipage?title=http%3a%2f%2fsystem.data.sqlite.org%2findex.html%2fdoc%2ftrunk%2fwww%2fdownloads.wiki&referringTitle=Home\">\r\nhttp://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki</a></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
