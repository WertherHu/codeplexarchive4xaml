How about just one in simple cases, and only a handful in more complex scenarios?<br /><br />Examples:\n<ul><li>RedChip.MoveTo(50, 50, 1.2.seconds()).Begin();</li>\n<li>BlackChip.RotateBy(BlackChip.GetCenter(), -90, 0.3.seconds()).Begin();</li></ul>\n<br />Read the article for an explanation of the core concepts, and see some more code examples: <br /><a href=\"http://dvanderboom.wordpress.com/2009/12/31/animate-net-fluent-animation-library-for-silverlight-wpf/\">http://dvanderboom.wordpress.com/2009/12/31/animate-net-fluent-animation-library-for-silverlight-wpf/</a><br /><br />It is meant to be the beginning of a community conversation around fluent code-based animation for Silverlight and WPF.  The goal is to enable succinct, intuitive code to easily create animations, compose multiple animations into groups, and define reusable, parameterized animations and animation libraries.  It&#39;s not aimed at duplicating a physics engine like Balder, though some simple physics may be included (as an implementation detail) to achieve specific common effects.<br /><br />Where would you like to see this API go?
