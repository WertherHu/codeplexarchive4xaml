Due to lack of a level editor I would currently recommend this engine more towards those with C# knowledge. If you want a full fledged engine with a level editor for XNA I would look into something like the SunBurn Game Engine.<br /><br />Developing games with the QuickStart Engine is completely free. Both <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-csharp-express\">Visual Studio C# 2010 Express</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=23714\">XNA</a> are free to download and use, as well as this engine, which is open-source.<br /><br />Feel free to <a href=\"mailto:nfoste82@gmail.com\">send us screenshots</a> of your project, we love to see what people can get out of the engine. Also, with your permission, we may post your screenshot with a link to your website.<br /><br /><b>Buoyancy and Density physics (now through the BEPU physics engine)</b><br /><img src=\"/projects/QuickStartEngine/d827abe4-0233-4e68-9f82-d99828661743\" alt=\"physicsbouyancy027.jpg\" title=\"physicsbouyancy027.jpg\" /><br /><br /><b>Model texturing, normal mapping, particle emitters, and shadow mapping</b><br /><img src=\"/projects/QuickStartEngine/c1d44cc9-ab39-4920-8fee-a80c7f9513c7\" alt=\"QSversion027.jpg\" title=\"QSversion027.jpg\" /><br /><br /><b>Water with reflection, refraction, and shoreline detection</b><br /><img src=\"/projects/QuickStartEngine/3026259e-39c9-4928-bbea-e7ad09f00a02\" alt=\"water027.jpg\" title=\"water027.jpg\" /><br /><br /><b>In-game GUI (using Nuclex GUI Framework with some custom enhancements)</b><br /><img src=\"/projects/QuickStartEngine/cbc42d46-8325-470e-80c5-34ccbe74b0e8\" alt=\"QSWithGUI.jpg\" title=\"QSWithGUI.jpg\" /><br />\n<h3>Screenshots</h3>\r<ul><li>Click here for <a href=\"https://quickstartengine.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=screenshots&referringTitle=Home\">screenshots</a> (56k warning, large images in this section)</li></ul>\n<br /><b>Fun with physics, QuickStart Engine uses the BEPU Physics Engine for its physics (since v0.27)</b><br /><img src=\"/projects/QuickStartEngine/a6d59217-d5f7-4e8a-a8da-bd3d326f9bea\" alt=\"funWithBlocks.jpg\" title=\"funWithBlocks.jpg\" /><br /><br /><b>A debug display for physics meshes.
