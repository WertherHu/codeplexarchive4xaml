  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\">\r\n<p><strong>Project Description</strong><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple demonstration of data streaming in WPF satisfying a requirement to display data as soon as its available rather than resorting to graphical animation and forcing the user to wait before all data is loaded in memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demonstration uses a DataReader, ObservableCollection and a background thread (that fills up the ObservableCollection). The demonstration binds\r\n<strong>millions</strong> of records to 3 controls (a bit of exagerration to drive a point) without sacrificing UI performance.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demonstration also shows how to implement pausing and continuing the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img title=\"8-18-2012 5-20-32 PM.png\" src=\"http://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=wpfstreamdemo&DownloadId=472104\" alt=\"8-18-2012 5-20-32 PM.png\"></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
