An application built on Wtf Framework may consist of many different modules, which provide different kinds of functionality through Module Services and Service Extensions.<br /><br />Currently Wtf Manager Framework is used to build a set of File Manager modules.<br />Wtf Manager UI Modules are being built on <a href=\"http://avalondock.codeplex.com/\">AvalonDock Library</a>.<br /><br /><b>Project Status</b><br />Abandoned. :( The project code is quite old and requires a lot of effort to update it to the current technologies and tools. It was started in an effort to learn WPF and long before MVVM frameworks matured, so it&#39;s code doesn&#39;t add any value for today&#39;s developers. It might be interesting as a set of Win API examples, though.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
