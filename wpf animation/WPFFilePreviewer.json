The screen-shots below are from the demo and show previews of a Visio drawing, &nbsp;a PowerPoint slide, an mp3 file and a jpeg. (The icons to the right of the file names in the\r\n screen shots are from the&nbsp;ImageSource property of the control.)</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong>Screenshots</strong></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><img title=\"visio.png\" src=\"/projects/WPFFilePreviewer/f3dea934-585a-4b27-93db-e9fde42e6819\" alt=\"Previewing a visio diagram\" height=\"250\">&nbsp;<img src=\"/projects/WPFFilePreviewer/b421eec0-5a27-48e8-aa79-03cbc0bcded9\" alt=\"Previewing a jpeg\" height=\"250\">&nbsp;<img src=\"/projects/WPFFilePreviewer/69902113-28a7-4b27-a30f-b419268451ec\" alt=\"Previewing a PowerPoint slide\" height=\"250\">&nbsp;<img src=\"/projects/WPFFilePreviewer/6a14a841-586c-4877-bb21-7ef9cd12c169\" alt=\"Previewing an mp3\" height=\"250\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>Most of the heavy lifting for the control occurs in a class written by Brad Smith in his blog column,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.brad-smith.info/blog/archives/183\" target=\"_blank\">Preview Handlers Revisited</a>.</p>\r\n<p>My contributions, apart from packaging it as a WPF control, include cleaning up a couple of snags in the code-base that caused previewing to hang. (After previewing an Excel file, previewing a second Excel file would fail.&nbsp;Resizing the preview window\r\n would fail. Mht files failed with&nbsp;protected memory errors.) I also extended the range of previewable file types and added a nice little ImageSource function for displaying the icon corresponding to a file type. You can also databind both to it and the\r\n control's FileName property, as I have done in the demo source code.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong>Care and Feeding</strong></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Download the WpfDocumentPreviewer.dll or the&nbsp;WpfDocumentPreviewer project source files.&nbsp;\r\n</li><li>Add a reference to WpfDocumentPreviewer in&nbsp;your project, </li><li>Add a WpfDocumentPreviewer&nbsp;control to your WPF xaml (see the xaml below)\r\n</li><li>Set the WpfDocumentPreviewer&nbsp;control's Filename property in your code behind (see the c# code below)\r\n</li><li>Optionally, set an image control's Source property to the WpfDocumentPreviewer&nbsp;control's ImageSource.\r\n</li></ol>\r\n<div style=\"color:black\">xmlns:WpfDocumentPreviewer=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;clr-namespace:WpfDocumentPreviewer;assembly=WpfDocumentPreviewer&quot;</span>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;WpfDocumentPreviewer:PreviewerControl x:Name=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;previewControl&quot;</span> /&gt;</div>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>previewControl.FileName = od.FileName;\r\n\r\nimgExtension.Source = previewControl.ImageSource;</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong>What is a File Previewer?</strong></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">A file previewer allows users to see the contents of a file without having to open the underlying application for the file type. Of course, the user's system still has to have the underlying application installed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">The previewer in this project is based on the Outlook 2007 attachment file previewer, which has origins as described below:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px; font-size:9pt\">&quot;Every version of Microsoft Windows and Office brings new methods and approaches for improving your ability to see, interact with, and understand data...&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#333333; font-size:9pt\">Outlook 2003\r\n provided a reading pane for e-mail that made it easy to view the contents of a message without having to open it. You simply selected the message in the mail folder's list view, and the message was rendered in a side or bottom window.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#333333; font-size:9pt\">Outlook\r\n 2007 extends this concept by allowing you to view message attachments in that same preview pane, without having to double-click an attachment to open it in the appropriate viewer.&quot;<br>\r\n</span><span style=\"font-size:9pt; color:#333333\">--&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#26252a; font-size:9pt\">Stephen Toub,&nbsp;&lsquo;<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/01/PreviewHandlers/default.aspx\">View Data Your Way With Our Managed Preview\r\n Handler Framework</a>&lsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
