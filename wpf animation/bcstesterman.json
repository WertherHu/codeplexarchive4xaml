You'll no longer have to create and configure Business Data Web Parts or External Lists. It's developed in C#. UI is WPF\r\n with MVVM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>This project was created and is maintained by Phill Duffy , an employee of Lightning Tools Ltd (<a href=\"http://www.lightningtools.com\">www.lightningtools.com</a>).\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Lightning Tools Ltd\" href=\"http://www.lightningtools.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img title=\"lttoolpart\" border=\"0\" alt=\"lttoolpart\" src=\"http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=bcstesterman&DownloadId=187818\" width=\"225\" height=\"66\" style=\"border-bottom:0px; border-left:0px; padding-left:0px; padding-right:0px; display:inline; border-top:0px; border-right:0px; padding-top:0px\"></a></p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nThis project is developed in my spare time for the wider Business Connectivity Services (BCS) Developers.</p>\r\n<p>Having worked with BCS Models and External Content Types for a while one of the biggest pains is if a model deploys successfully it doesn't always mean that it is working. You have to open the page, edit the a bcs web part and then check it. If it's not\r\n working then you still need to go to the logs to find out what exactly went wrong. The Idea of BCSTesterMan is to just allow you to deploy your model, open up BCS Tester Man, select the method and just check to see if some data is returned. The benefit of\r\n having it in a client is that you can test all methods, some like the IdEnumerator are difficult to test normally.</p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"501\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"244\">\r\n<p><strong>Using a Finder Method</strong></p>\r\n<p>This finder method has a wildcard filter and a limit filter.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"255\"><img title=\"Finder Method with Filters\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Finder Method with Filters\" src=\"http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=bcstesterman&DownloadId=187688\" width=\"240\" height=\"217\" style=\"border-bottom:0px; border-left:0px; padding-left:0px; padding-right:0px; display:inline; border-top:0px; border-right:0px; padding-top:0px\"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"240\">\r\n<p><strong>Using a Specific Finder Method</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"259\"><img title=\"Specific Finder Method\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Specific Finder Method\" src=\"http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=bcstesterman&DownloadId=187689\" width=\"240\" height=\"217\" style=\"border-bottom:0px; border-left:0px; padding-left:0px; padding-right:0px; display:inline; border-top:0px; border-right:0px; padding-top:0px\"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"240\"><strong>When it doesnâ€™t work? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</strong>You get to see the exception message straight away.
