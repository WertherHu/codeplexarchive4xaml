While we need a full series of Persian calendar components for our WPF projects, I didn&#39;t find any appropriate component.<br /><br />But suddenly I faced with a blog<sup><a href=\"https://persianwpftoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=1&referringTitle=Home\">1</a></sup> which introduced a very good implementation of such components. The author (Mohammadreza) has changed the SilverlightToolkit to support the Persian calendar as Gregorian. It&#39;s great, but it isn&#39;t WPF. Thanks to Mohammadrezaâ€™s idea I started to do such work on WPFToolkit. With due respect I surprised for some dirty and hasty implementation (However it&#39;s a great implementation overall).<br /><br />You can find more about this project author at <a href=\"http://www.dev-frame.com\">www.dev-frame.com</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://persianwpftoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=1&referringTitle=Home\">1</a> <a href=\"https://mrtaikandi.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/silverlight-4-persian-calendar-and-datepicker-using-globalcalendar\">https://mrtaikandi.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/silverlight-4-persian-calendar-and-datepicker-using-globalcalendar</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
