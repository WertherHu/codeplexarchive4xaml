I have referred to numerous GDI+ code samples and tutorials in the leraning process and creating this project. So my gratitude goes to all those unnamed developers whom I got help from.

At the time of the upload, the project was converted to Visual Studio 2010 format (as I didn't have VS2005). But it still targets .Net Framework 2.0 runtime version. So if you have an\r\n older VS version than Visual Studio 2010, you can create a blank project and add these files to your project and it will work.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ravin Perera</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ravinsp.blogspot.com\">http://ravinsp.blogspot.com</a></p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
