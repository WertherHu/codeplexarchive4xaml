This project provides similar functionality for Silverlight 2: it accepts string with path definition, and return PathGeometry object which could be used in Silverlight 2 applications to set “Data” property for Path object. Also, it can convert PathGeometry object back to string with path definition.\nSupports IValueConverter to ease using in data binding scenarios.\n\n*NOTE: current code was ported from WPF source code and corresponds to Silverlight 2 RC0.",
