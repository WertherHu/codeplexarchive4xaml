  "Description": "Agro2D is a 2D game engine/framework for XNA. At present Agro2D includes the following functionality: input mapping and abstraction, loading of levels and sprites from XML, scene management: layering and drawing, a flexible animation system, a camera system, per-pixel and bounding box collision detection, a state system, texture caching and resource management, a logging system and various other common game utilities.\nAgro2D is designed to be extensible, so you should be able to create new Sprites, Animations and Levels and they will still work as their base types.\nAgro2D is evolving and growing,  we hope to stabilise the interface when we are confident it is prevalent to do so.",
