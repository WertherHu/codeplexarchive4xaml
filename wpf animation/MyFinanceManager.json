Your smaller expenses should be tracked with a WindowsMobile (5.0 or 6.1). Small means all expenses you handle with your wallet. This is why the WM-software is very simple and not fully featured. It only should be very fast and easy to handle. <br /><br />If you want to manage complexer expenses like rent or other periodical spending, there&#39;s a desktop client. This part of the software also can book earnings. It additionally should be able to make some kind of statistics. May be. <br /><br />The WM-client is developed on .Net-Compact 3.5<br />The Desktop-client is develop on .Net 3.5 and should use WPF.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
