I had encountered several issues with Sql Server Compact after deployment that I couldn&#39;t recreate in debug mode. The code had also become complex more difficult to maintain. I decided to rewrite the data layer and make it more simple and WPF friendly. I stripped things down and did alot of refactoring and got it to a point where everything is stored in the app.config. This has reduced the dependancies significantly and has improved startup performance.\n<h2>Technologies Used</h2>\r<ul><li>.NET 3.5 SP1</li>\n<li>Windows Presentation Foundation</li></ul></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
