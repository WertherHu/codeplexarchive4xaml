Luckily I found an excellent winforms version by Eric Haddan. This project is a port over of that winforms version to WPF, and implements the MVVM design pattern. I have avoided using any MVVM frameworks because I wanted people to be able to just compile the project and burn their media. To get the application looking good I am using a free WPF theme from reuxables, to remove or change this you will need to comment out the resource dictionary reference on the .App.xaml and delete any Style tags.<br /><br />This is still a work in progress, but you should have 90 to 95% parity with the original release.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
