It will allow Media playback, file updates, backup programs etc. to function as if they are talking to networked shared drive.</p>\r\n<h2>OS Requirements:</h2>\r\n<p>This uses the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718\">\r\n.Net4 x32 <em>Full</em> profile</a>, so please install that.<br>\r\nYou will also need to install <a href=\"http://dokan-dev.net/en/download/\">Dokan </a>\r\nfor the OS you are using.</p>\r\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Q</strong> Aren't there other (<em><a href=\"http://amalgam.codeplex.com/discussions/258996\">free) offerings</a></em> that do this?<br>\r\n<strong>A</strong> Yes there are, but I was not able to find one that worked reliably and at the full potential of both read and write speeds in Win 7 and above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Q</strong> Why do this?<br>\r\n<strong>A</strong> I wanted a drive that took an FTP target and placed it into windows as a drive in explorer (and dos); so that Media players could extract data and play large 1080p files without jitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Q</strong> Why C#?<br>\r\n<strong>A</strong> This is so that any memory that is being used is tidied up cleanly by the OS, and to make any interface pretty via the use of WCF (later on :-))<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Q</strong> Hasn't Dokan got a <em>few</em> issues?<br>\r\n<strong>A</strong> Yes, but these are mainly to do with security access, and mapped file access.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>A2</strong> By (currently) setting the Dokan driver to be a network drive, this allows a lot of the\r\n<em>problem</em> applications to work (e.g. notepad is the quickest to show these problems)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Q</strong> What about WebDav?<br>\r\n<strong>A</strong> I suppose that this could be extended to perform such functions, but currently is beyond the scope of this first phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Q</strong> What about SFTP / FTPS ?<br>\r\n<strong>A</strong> The StarkSoftFTP library does have this functionality, and it could be used later on - any volunteers to take that part on ?</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://i3.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=amalgam&DownloadId=352435\" alt=\"Demo Image showing DOS usage\" width=\"698\" height=\"493\"></p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"758\" height=\"195\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"http://www4.clustrmaps.com/user/c57db836\"><img src=\"http://www4.clustrmaps.com/stats/maps-no_clusters/amalgam.codeplex.com--thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Locations of visitors to this page\" width=\"321\" height=\"211\">\r\n</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
