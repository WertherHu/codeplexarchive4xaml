  "Description": "The major focus of this project is to establish a set extension methods that allow the Ajax Control Toolkit to be used within an MVC Web Application.\n\nNone of us miss the postback model, nor the viewstate garbage, but I do miss the calendar, masked edit control, validator popout and several other controls found in the Ajax Control Toolkit.\n\nHaving said that, I will be trying to release at least 3 controls per week. My intention is that beta 1 will include all items that do not contain child elements and will have limited to no support for animations. Animations will be added for Beta 2 and then a nice work around for child controls...but of course, this idea will most like change as time goes on.",
