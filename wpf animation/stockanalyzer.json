Also some documentation has been updated to reflect the current status (database, and others).<br /><br />I&#39;m planning to improve the plugins documentation as I&#39;m creating a third version of the base plugin infrastructure to be able to execute in parallel engines wherever is possible (as I have almost 2 years of data executing plugins with all the data is becoming really slow).<br /><br />I&#39;m still planning also to release a version with a installer to let you try the tool easily.<br /><br />Check here the archive: <a href=\"https://stockanalyzer.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=News&referringTitle=Home\">News</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
