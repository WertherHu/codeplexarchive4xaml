This engine support flat lighting system for SolidColorBrush and GradientBrush&#39;s.<br />I maked this engine for my company <a href=\"http://www.axelerate.com\">aXelerate Inc</a> because we want to create 3D Charts. But other projects like Kit3D don&#39;t have the necesary elements that we need, like XAML support and flat lights.<br />This engine is still generic and probably we go to continue adding functionality as we need for our projects (unless until Microsoft release the silverlight 3.0 with real 3D). Betwen I hope that this project can be usefull for the comunity and for give ideas to other projects.<br />All the source code is c# and is available for download and use.<br /><br />Requirements:<br />Microsoft Visual Studio to compile the code. <br />Silverlight 2.0 SDK.<br /><br />If you want see it running you can go to <a href=\"http://www.axelerate.com/SilverlightSamples/Silverlight3D/\">axelerate website</a><br /><br /><img src=\"http://content.screencast.com/users/toducs/folders/Jing/media/b45224db-8d92-4766-be54-4f9b73b939c7/2008-12-04_1357.png\" /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
