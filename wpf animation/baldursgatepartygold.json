Of course application fulfills the function of an editor.<br /><br /><b>Model View Presenter - ViewModel</b><br />MVP-VM sample WPF, Windows Forms MVP-VM sample<br /><br />MVP-VM provides all of the power and capability of MVVM while introducing the scalability and extensibility of the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern<br /><br /><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q9ktjK1G46c/TyAxbmr4nRI/AAAAAAAAAEE/vB9nyezb4Dc/s1600/mvpvm.png\" /><br /><br />Good articles on MVP-VM ;<br /><a href=\"http://www.global-webnet.net/blogengine/post/2010/02/05/MVPVM-Model-View-Presenter-View-Model-the-natural-evolution.aspx\">http://www.global-webnet.net/blogengine/post/2010/02/05/MVPVM-Model-View-Presenter-View-Model-the-natural-evolution.aspx</a><br /><a href=\"http://aviadezra.blogspot.com/2009/08/mvp-mvvm-winforms-data-binding.html\">http://aviadezra.blogspot.com/2009/08/mvp-mvvm-winforms-data-binding.html</a><br /><br /><b>Baldur&#39;s Gate Party Gold Editor</b><br /><br />The popularity and success of MVVM overshadows MVPVM even though MVPVM is the evolution of MVVM, also not a lot of articles and code samples about MVP-VM.<br /><br />MVP-VM pattern can be used both WPF and Windows Forms applications by changing only View.<br /><br />The only problem I encountered while making this example, Windows Forms applications is incompatible with WPF Commands. I solved this problem by using a WAF.<br /><br />WPF Application Framework (WAF) provides compatibility of WPF Commands for Windows Forms application with Windows Forms Adapter inclueded in WAF Framework.<br /><br />For Details ;<br /><a href=\"http://waf.codeplex.com/\">http://waf.codeplex.com/</a><br /><br />I used the Castle Inversion of Control container for Views and Presenters.<br /><br />Github page of project : <a href=\"https://github.com/Blind-Striker/baldursgatepartygold\">https://github.com/Blind-Striker/baldursgatepartygold</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
