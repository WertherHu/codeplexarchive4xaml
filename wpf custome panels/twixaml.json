For a starting point we have implemented it using the Twitterizer library for C# but we will soon shift it to WCF completely. Features we are looking forward to include are:<br /><br /><br />*WCF based communication<br />*Cache (so that we dont run in rate limit)<br /><br /><br />interested in helping us out? feel free :)</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
