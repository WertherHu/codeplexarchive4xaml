It was quite boring to write similar code for every command definition. The well known RelayCommand (Josh Smith) helps a lot but there is still similar code for every command definition.<br />- private ICommand member<br />- public ICommand getter incl. creation logic<br /><br />If you have to create views with a lot of functionality (many customers still like screens full of data and functionalities), for example ToolBars and ContextMenus also a lot of commands has to be defined.<br /><br />This leads to a great amount of code lines with very similar structure. <br /><br /><b>Example (<u>without</u> Command Aggregator):</b><br /><pre>\nprivate ICommand printCommand;\npublic ICommand PrintCommand\n{\n     get\n     {\n          if (this.printCommand == null)\n          {\n              this.printCommand = new RelayCommand(p1 =&gt; Print(p1), p2 =&gt; CanPrint);\n          }\n          return this.printCommand;\n      }\n}\n</pre><br /><br />All we want to tell is: <i>PrintCommand</i> executes the <i>Print</i> method if it is allowed (<i>CanPrint</i> property).<br /><br />The WPF Command Aggregator is a solution to reduce the command definitions to a very short and easy to read line of code within a view model class.<br /><br /><b>Example (<u>with</u> Command Aggregator):</b><br /><pre>\nthis.CmdAgg.AddOrSetCommand(&quot;Print&quot;, new RelayCommand(p1 =&gt; Print(p1), p2 =&gt; CanPrint));\n</pre><br /><br />This is an reduction of about 10 lines (!!!) and (in my opinion) a very easy to read command definition.<br />How can this be achieved and how we can use it for bindings (XAML)?<br />\n<h1>The Implementation</h1>\r\nThe Command Aggreagtor is a class containing a dictionary (ConcurrentDictionary) to hold commands identified by a string (command name):<br /><pre>\nprivate readonly ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, ICommand&gt; commands;\n\npublic CommandAggregator()\n{\n   commands = new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, ICommand&gt;();\n}\n</pre><br /><br />A method called <i>AddOrSetCommand</i> (overloaded) provides the registration of new commands:<br /><br /><pre>\npublic void AddOrSetCommand(string key, ICommand command)\n{\n   if (this.commands.Any(k =&gt; k.Key == key))\n   {\n      this.commands[key] = command;\n   }\n   else\n   {\n      this.commands.AddOrUpdate(key, command, (exkey, excmd) =&gt; command);\n    }\n}\n\npublic void AddOrSetCommand(string key, Action&lt;object&gt; executeDelegate, Predicate&lt;object&gt; canExecuteDelegate)\n{\n   if (this.commands.Any(k =&gt; k.Key == key))\n   {\n      this.commands[key] = new RelayCommand(executeDelegate, canExecuteDelegate);\n   }\n   else\n   {\n      ICommand command = new RelayCommand(executeDelegate, canExecuteDelegate);\n      this.commands.AddOrUpdate(key, command, (exkey, excmd) =&gt; command);\n   }\n}\n</pre><br /><br />So, we have the functionaliy to collect commands within a CommandAggregator class, but how we can use it - especially in Bindings?<br />First of all my BaseViewModel class is provided with one CommandAggregator instance and an abstract <br />method called <i>InitCommands</i>.<br /><br /><pre>\npublic abstract class BaseVm : INotifyPropertyChanged\n{\n   private CommandAggregator cmdAgg = new CommandAggregator();\n   public CommandAggregator CmdAgg\n   {\n       get\n       {\n           return this.cmdAgg;\n        }\n   }\n\n   protected abstract void InitCommands();\n\n   protected BaseVm()\n   {\n        this.InitCommands();\n   }\n\n   // ... further elements of the base view model\n}\n</pre><br /><br />The abstract <i>InitCommands</i> method is the place where the commands will be registered/defined within each view model.<br /><pre>\npublic class MainVm : BaseVm\n{\n   protected sealed override void InitCommands()\n   {\n      this.CmdAgg.AddOrSetCommand(&quot;Print&quot;, new RelayCommand(p1 =&gt; Print(p1), p2 =&gt; CanPrint));\n   }\n\n   // ... more view model code ...\n}\n</pre><br /><br />But there is still one problem left: How do we bind the commands?<br />At this point an indexer can help us. Indexers can be used in Bindings for a OneWay binding. Commands do not use TwoWay bindings, so an indexer within the CommandAggregator class enables us to establish a command binding in XAML.<br /><br /><pre>\n   public ICommand this[string key]\n   {\n       get\n       {\n           // The indexer is using the GetCommand-Method\n           return this.GetCommand(key);\n       }\n    }\n\n    public ICommand GetCommand(string key)\n    {\n       if (this.commands.Any(k =&gt; k.Key == key))\n       {\n          return this.commands[key];\n       }\n       else\n       {\n          // Empty command (to avoid null reference exceptions)\n          return new RelayCommand(p1 =&gt; { });\n        }  \n      }\n</pre><br />\n<h1>Usage</h1>\r\nIn XAML we can use the CommandAggregator instance of the view model like this:<br /><br /><pre>\n&lt;Button Content=&quot;Print&quot; Command=&quot;{Binding CmdAgg[Print]}&quot; /&gt;\n</pre><br /><br />Indexer binding works with square brackets and the name of the registered command - you do not need any quotation marks!<br /><br />The WPF Command Aggregator is working well in my current and previous projects. I was able to reduce the lines of code for command definitions for more than 2000 (within my current project) without loosing any functionality! Each command definition/registration is reduced to exact one line of code.<br /><br />Thanks to Gerhard Ahrens for all the discussions and testing after work time!<br />\n<h1>Hierarchy Command (Version 1.1.0.0)</h1>\r\nWith version 1.1.0.0 the target framework version was set to 4.5.1.<br />This version also comes with a new feature - I called it the <b>HierarchyCommand</b>.<br /><br />This command also implements the ICommand interface and derives from the RelayCommand class.<br />A HierarchyCommand can have child commands. Therefore the HierarchyCommand depends on the child commands. Fore example: a SaveAll command depends on the save commands of all child commands.<br />To configure the dependency of the HierarchyCommand startegies can be used for Execute and CanExecute:<br /><br /><b>HierarchyCanExecuteStrategy</b>\n<ul><li>DependsOnMasterCommandOnly</li>\n<li>DependsOnAllChilds</li>\n<li>DependsOnAtLeastOneChild</li></ul>\n<br /><b>HierarchyExecuteStrategy</b>\n<ul><li>MasterCommandOnly</li>\n<li>AllChildsOnly</li>\n<li>MasterAndAllChilds</li></ul>\n<br />With these values many business cases can be realized.<br /><br /><u>A short example:</u><br /><pre>\n   // Adding a hierarchy command\n   ICommand save1Cmd = new RelayCommand(p1 =&gt; Save1(), p2 =&gt; this.CanSave1);\n   ICommand save2Cmd = new RelayCommand(p1 =&gt; Save2(), p2 =&gt; this.CanSave2);\n\n   this.CmdAgg.AddOrSetCommand(&quot;SaveCmd1&quot;, save1Cmd);\n   this.CmdAgg.AddOrSetCommand(&quot;SaveCmd2&quot;, save2Cmd);\n\n   HierarchyCommand saveAllCmd = new HierarchyCommand(\n                p1 =&gt; {  },  -- no Execute required due to HierarchyExecuteStrategy\n                p2 =&gt; null,  -- CanExecute not required due to HierarchyCanExecuteStrategy\n                HierarchyExecuteStrategy.AllChildsOnly,\n                HierarchyCanExecuteStrategy.DependsOnAllChilds);\n\n   saveAllCmd.AddChildsCommand(new List&lt;ICommand&gt; { save1Cmd, save2Cmd });\n   this.CmdAgg.AddOrSetCommand(&quot;SaveAll&quot;, saveAllCmd); \n</pre><br />\n<h1>Pre- and post action delegates (Version 1.2.0.0)</h1>\r\nThis version comes with a new feature - the <b>pre - and post action delegates</b>.<br /><br />The RelayCommand was extended by two delegates &quot;PreActionDelegate&quot; and &quot;PostActionDelegate&quot;.<br />This enables you to add logic to run before and after the command execution delegate runs.<br />Therefore these delegates enables you to &quot;inject&quot; cross cutting concerns without the need to change your execution delegate logic.<br /><br /><u>A short example (performance messurement):</u><br /><pre>\n            this.CmdAgg.AddOrSetCommand(\n                                        &quot;Print&quot;, \n                                        new RelayCommand(\n                                            p1 =&gt; MessageBox.Show(&quot;Print called&quot;), \n                                            p2 =&gt; true, \n                                            this.performanceChecker.Start, \n                                            this.performanceChecker.Stop));\n</pre><br /><br />The performanceChecker instance is only a wrapper class to start and stop a stopwatch instance and writes the ellapsed time to the debug window. You can use any Action delegate.<br /><br />When you like to set/change/remove these actions dynamically you can use the corresponding methods of the RelayCommand class.<br /><pre>\n            RelayCommand cmd = this.CmdAgg[&quot;Print&quot;] as RelayCommand;\n            if (cmd != null)\n            {\n                 cmd.OverridePostActionDelegate(null);\n                 cmd.OverridePreActionDelegate(null);\n            }\n</pre><br /><br />(see also the example solution (source code))<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
