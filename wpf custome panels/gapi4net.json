Google introduced a set of technique that we can use at server side (request from the Url that expose as service from Google) and client side (request through Javascript library). Gapi4net, however, only wrapped some of API from the server side. And in this library we wrapped many APIs as: Web, Local, Video, Blog, News, Book, Image, Patent and specially is Google translation.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>We wrapped this because sometimes we need build some of components at server side and expose to client only HTML code, javascript and css script. Maybe we also need get some information from the service that expose from Google API at server side and that is reason we made this library.<br>If some people are going to use Gapi4net, they shall recognize that they are very easy to call the service from Google API through our library. To see that benefit, please see our example as below:</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">var</span> webResult = Gapi4NetFactory&lt;Web&gt;\n                .Init()\n                .With(x =&gt; x.Version, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;1.0&quot;</span>)\n                .With(x =&gt; x.Query, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Google&quot;</span>)\n                .Create();\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">var</span> blogResult = Gapi4NetFactory&lt;Blog&gt;\n                .Init()\n                .With(x =&gt; x.Version, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;1.0&quot;</span>)\n                .With(x =&gt; x.Query, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Google&quot;</span>)\n                .Create();\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>As you saw, we have supported the Lambda Expression for our library so all things shall be easy to using.<br>And to make you easy to use our library, we coded two examples solution in ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1 and WPF to proved our possibility solution.</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>For more information about Gapi4net please go to:</div>\n<div class=wikidoc>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/thangchung/archive/2010/09/13/google-api-for-net-architecture-part-1.aspx\">Introduce Gapi4net architecture - Part 1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/thangchung/archive/2010/09/16/google-api-for-net-architecture-part-2.aspx\">Introduce Gapi4net architecture&nbsp;- Part 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/thangchung/archive/2010/09/21/google-api-for-net-architecture-part-3.aspx\">Introduce Gapi4net architecture&nbsp;- Part 3</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
