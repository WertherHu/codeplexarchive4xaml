It does not contain the &#34;Line Drawing Language&#34; itself.<br /><br />Here is the gist of it:<br /><br /><div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\nGrid Viewer;\nTextBox Program;\nProgram.Text = <span style=\"color:#A31515;\">&quot;r * d * d * r * u * l&quot;</span>;\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">void</span> Program_TextChanged()\n{\n    Canvas c = LineDrawingLanguage.Compile(Program.Text);\n    Viewer.Children.Clear();\n    Viewer.Children.Add(c);\n}\r\n</pre></div>Which gives:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/linedrawingdemo/d7697fcc-2c52-4663-8d4b-dbcf31232d05\" alt=\"simple.png\" title=\"simple.png\" /><br /><br /><b>Q1</b> Why would anybody do such a silly thing? After all, it just displays primitive lines that could be drawn (programmatically or otherwise) by other means.<br /><b>A1.1</b> The primary interest here is the usage of Oslo&#39;s MGrammar to define and compose line drawings.<br /><b>A1.2</b> &quot;Grammatical Picture Generation&quot; is a concept that is past its due time (see <b>Inspiration</b>).<br /><br /><b>Q2</b> Why all those asterisks? It could be: &quot;rddrul&quot;.<br /><b>A2</b> asterisk is just the concatenation operator; orther operators (such as union, translation, rotation) are in incubation.<br /><br />By the way, for now, &quot;no operator&quot; is union:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/linedrawingdemo/47fc74ae-06ed-42f0-96c9-c9b2bdf7e7de\" alt=\"SomeGrid.png\" title=\"SomeGrid.png\" /><br /><br /><b>Inspiration</b><br />This project is inspired by the book:<br /><b>Grammatical Picture Generation: A Tree-Based Approach</b><br />by Frank Drewes<br />ISBN: 354021304<br /><a href=\"http://www.cs.umu.se/~drewes/picgen\">Mr. Drewes Site</a><br /><br /><b>Dependencies</b><br />Consisting of only the sources of the demo program, this project depends on the <b>LineDrawingLanguage.dll</b> which is available <a href=\"https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=linedrawingdemo&DownloadId=67851\">here</a> (in Downloads) in binary form only.<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
