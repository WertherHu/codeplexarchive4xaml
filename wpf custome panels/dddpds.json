The book is one large case study of a real-world application, named SmartCA, which is a smart client application implemented with the latest .NET technologies and following DDD principles.\r\n\r\nThe application is a smart client built using WPF (recently migrated to .NET 4.0), with a local SQL Server Compact 3.5 database as its data store.  The framework and SQL CE bits used are all from the Visual Studio 2010 RTM release.  The application uses a custom developed solution to sychronize with the server (Synchronization Framework) using messages, as well as a custom client-side membership implementation (Client Membership System) that is built on top of the Synchronization Framework..",
