There is no file system browser yet, but the current setup consists of a working start menu, and working taskbar, and a working notification area. Small pieces are missing in what is there, and there are probably many bugs. It is not yet recommended that you use it regularly, except for testing.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
