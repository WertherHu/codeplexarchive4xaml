In the first time when I create a WPF program, i said: &quot;Why we just have some built-in WPF controls?&quot;. WPF allow you to do everything but I don&#39;t want to make everything, I want to use everything :-) It&#39;s the reason I implement this library.<br /><br /><b>Which control will be implemented?</b>\n<ol><li><b>Vietnamese CalendarMonth</b> (or Lunar CalendarMonth)</li></ol>\n<i>You also can use this control for other culture but it support fully for Vietnamese culture (It&#39;s easy to understand what&#39;s the reason because i&#39;m a Vietnamese). You can find the lunar date (&#226;m lịch) and some other useful information (example: tiết kh&#237;). I also support displaying weekend and holiday in a different style. If you think you need more features, please let me know. I&#39;ll try my best.</i></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
