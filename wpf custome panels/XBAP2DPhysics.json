Itâ€™s based on a project called Flade, written in Actionscript (for use in Flash/Flex) by Alec Cove.<br /><br />This implementation adds some simple particle/particle collision (Flade does particle/fixed surface collision right now) and uses WPF for rendering.<br /><br />Currently the engine is built as part of the demo project.  It&#39;s in a subfolder and can easily be mored to its own assembly.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
