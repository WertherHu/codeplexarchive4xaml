(please see the attached tables.xml file)<br />The application should handle the following functionality for a single day. Assume that the restaurant operates from 10am to 10pm.<br /><br />\ta. Add reservation<br />\tb. Delete reservation<br />\tc. Edit reservation.<br /><br />While designing your application make the following considerations-<br /><br />\ta. Recovery if the app crashes. (Reservations should not be lost)<br />   b. Please make sure that the UI is always responsive.<br /><br />Assumptions:<br />============<br />1. Table data input file will be in correct format.<br />2. Default location for table.xml and reservation.xml will be ProgramData folder.<br /><br />Issues that I fixed before moving forward:<br />==========================================<br /><br />The input file Tables.xml was not in correct format:<br />1. Root &#39;Tables&#39; element didn&#39;t have correct closing tag.<br />2. All &#39;Table&#39; elements didn&#39;t have closing tags.<br /><br />I fixed it to read properly through XmlSerializer class.<br /><br />Prerequisites:<br />===============<br /><br />I have used couple of third party APIs in my solution. I have added them through NuGet Package manager directly from Project references in Solution.<br />NuGet Packages is used for development:<br />1. NLog for logging machanism.<br />2. AutoFac for Dependency Injections and IoC.<br />3. MahApp.Metro for Metro style UI.<br />4. Visual Studio 2013 Update 4<br /><br />Please do check following points before using the application:<br />1. Make sure you are connected to internet.<br />2. Build the code first which will download all NuGet packages required for this application.<br /><br />Application Supports following actions:<br />=======================================<br />1. User can add/remove/update reservations.<br />2. Summary of available tables.<br />3. Summary of total reservation for today and future.<br />4. Tooltip on each reservation to see the details.<br />5. Settings to change the input/output folder path.<br />6. Saving settings.<br />7. Saving reservation.<br />8. Not allowing user to add/update reservations in past.<br />9. Not allowing user to add/update reservations when store is closed.<br />10.Async implementation to make UI responsive.<br />11.Loading and Saving data in non-UI thread.<br />12.User cannot open multiple instances of an application.<br /><br />Architecture related points:<br />===============================<br /><br />1.\tImplemented project under MVVM design pattern.<br />2.\tSeparated Models and XML operations into separate class library.<br />3.\tXMLOperations are done to Serialize and Deserialize objects like, Tables, Reservations and Settings.<br />4.\tApplication mutex bound so only one instance can be used at a time.<br />5.\tNLog configured to store logs on exception.<br />6.\tMahApp dll is used to make application&#39;s look and feel like Metro theme based application.<br />7.\tAutoFac used for Dependency Injections and IoC.<br />8.\tSettings window implemented to store default file and folder path for the application. By default all data will be stored under C:/ProgramData/Reservations folder.<br />9.\tCustom ToolTips are available on controls.<br />10.\tXAML based validation has been implemented.<br />11.\tCustom XAML components like styles, tooltips, imagesources, converters, validations are stored into Resource Dictionary which we have merged into main dictionary.<br />12.\tImages are downloaded from internet. No copyrights have been violated.<br /><br /><br />Pending Tasks:<br />==================<br />â€¢\tUnit Test cases for the application.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
