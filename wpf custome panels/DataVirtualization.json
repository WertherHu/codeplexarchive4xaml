(<a href=\"http://bea.stollnitz.com/files/52/DataVirtualization.pdf\">http://bea.stollnitz.com/files/52/DataVirtualization.pdf</a>, <a href=\"http://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/?p=344\">http://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/?p=344</a>)</b><br /><br />[image:DataVirtualization.JPEG]<br /><br /><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />In a typical WPF + WCF LOB application, displaying and interacting a large data set is not a trivial task. While several posts on internet forums discuss data virtualization, none of them has all the following:\n<ul><li>Selection, sorting and filtering works well as if all data are stored locally;</li>\n<li>Data loading as needed, in a separate thread, without blocking the UI;</li>\n<li>Visual feedback when data is loading; if failed, user can retry the last failed attempt.</li></ul>\n<br />This highly reusable component resolves all the above issues.
