Brandi Besalke has set up a project to create one at <a href=\"http://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/\">http://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/</a> and has asked for help transcribing the entries..<br /><br />I signed up, but being the geek that I am, somewhere around the third entry that I transcribed, I began writing a program to do the repetitive bits for me. And here it is, in the hope that it will help other transcribers.<br /><br />To get started, see <a href=\"https://johnsonshelper.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Getting%20Started&referringTitle=Home\">Getting Started</a><br />For a description of how to use the helper, see  <a href=\"https://johnsonshelper.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Using%20the%20Helper&referringTitle=Home\">Using the Helper</a><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
