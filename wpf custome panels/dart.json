I then had to analyze each folder to check how many files it contained and how much memory it consumed one by one. What I needed was a graphical representation of a folder with its children and an easy viewing of its details. The existing XP and Windows 7 do not provide these details. Thus DART was born.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/dart/4d461a17-78ee-49aa-a234-6d5cc45d8d8a\" alt=\"DART.png\" title=\"DART.png\" /><br /><br />Features<br />\n<ul><li>Animated Graph</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/dart/7967f96b-a994-4ab8-8e80-50f492803729\" alt=\"DART1.png\" title=\"DART1.png\" /><br />\n<ul><li>Custom Tooltip</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/dart/fc28cd6c-8045-4e4a-b2b7-030a36685df6\" alt=\"DART2.png\" title=\"DART2.png\" /><br />\n<ul><li>Detailed ananlysis</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/dart/b56e5075-8a6c-47cf-9686-37badff4d7be\" alt=\"DART3.png\" title=\"DART3.png\" /><br />\n<ul><li>Folder Breakdown</li></ul>\n<br /><img src=\"/projects/dart/7f397921-9b8d-477c-ae06-b5f90699df2c\" alt=\"DART4.png\" title=\"DART4.png\" /><br /><br /><b>If you want to participate, please write to me at -anshu.dutta@gmail.com or get in touch through forums here.</b></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
