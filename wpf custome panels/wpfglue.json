WPFGlue is a programming strategy for WPF based on the idea of adding little bits and pieces that glue existing models and out-of-the-box WPF controls together in order to create complete applications.<br /><br /><br /><br />WPFGlue has been developed on <a href=\"http://wpfglue.wordpress.com\">http://wpfglue.wordpress.com</a> and will continue to live there. This project will contain the code base of WPFGlue and all example code.<br /><br />WPFGlue is not intended to be a ready to use library, but rather a collection of running examples for techniques you might want to implement in your own projects. However, if you want to use it as it is, feel free to do so...</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
