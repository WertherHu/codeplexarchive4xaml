  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\"><b>Project Description</b><br />A library containing Caliburn.Micro conventions for DevExpress&#39; visual controls.<br />Target platform&#58; WPF.<br />Inspired by <a href=\"https://github.com/vcaraulean/Caliburn.Micro.Telerik\">Caliburn.Micro.Telerik</a> package. Thanks, Valeriu Caraulean!<br /><br /><b>How to enable conventions</b><br />In your app&#39;s bootstrapper, in Configure override or in a static constructor add next line:<br />Caliburn.Micro.DevExpress.DXConventions.Install();<br />Of course, you need a DevExpress WPF subscription to use this package. It&#39;s compiled with v14.2.3.<br /><br /><b>Nuget package</b><br />Easiest way to use it is the <a href=\"https://nuget.org/packages/Caliburn.Micro.DevExpress\">Caliburn.Micro.DevExpress</a> package, but it works only if you use exactly the same DevExpress version as the package was compiled with. If you use other version, just download and compile the source code!<br /><br /><b>Currently supported DevExpress controls</b><br />I use this package in a project and develop them in parallel. I add conventions for DevExpress controls as I need them in my project. If you need conventions for other controls that I currently don&#39;t support, just create a new thread on the Discussions page and I will create them when I have some time. If you have other suggestions, they are also welcome on the Discussions page.<br />So, the currently supported DevExpress controls that have conventions:\n<ul><li>DataControlBase (GridControl, TreeListControl)</li>\n<li>PivotGridControl</li>\n<li>DataLayoutControl</li>\n<li>LookUpEditBase (LookUpEdit, GridLookUpEdit, SearchLookUpEdit)</li>\n<li>DocumentGroup (for tabbed documents)</li>\n<li>ChartControl</li>\n<li>BaseEdit (most editors)</li>\n<li>SpinEdit</li>\n<li>RangeBaseEdit (ProgressBarEdit and TrackBarEdit)</li></ul>\n<br /><b>Attaching messages to BarItem objects</b><br />If you want to use Caliburn.Micro&#39;s Message.Attach mechanism together with DXBars or DXRibbon, you can use my related project <a href=\"http://calmicrofce.codeplex.com/\">Caliburn.Micro.FrameworkContentElement</a>. I personally use these two packages together, too.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
