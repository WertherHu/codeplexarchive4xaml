The scripts control the AI of some combatants in a Quake III-style game. \r\n\r\nThe game can be used as a tool to get people interested in coding, or simply as a competitive game between different code.\r\n\r\nSome extensibility provided to create a simple sandbox environment. A \"director\" AI can be programmed to alter the dynamics of the game for a customizable experience. The \"director\" can also add custom entities that it would control. \r\n\r\nScripts are currently written in-game in C#, but any .NET language should be supported.
