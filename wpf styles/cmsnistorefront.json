Why not razor I feel wile razor is good it does have its limitations if the community feels strong enough I will make a razor version but for now lets build on what we no.<br /><br />I will be using EF 4.5 throughout this project as their is no need for other third party or mappers when the tools already exist in .net. <br /><br />One feature I am really wanting to implement and i am hopping that the community will help me is a drag and drop form builder  </div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
