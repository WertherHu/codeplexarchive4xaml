  "Description": "Just another script compressor, and that's by far the easiest to use! Use Jasc to merge compress your javascript (JS) and style sheets (CSS). Jasc is meant to be simple yet effective: just drop the executable in your javascript / CSS folder and run it. Voyla! It will handle everything by itself.\r\n\r\nCompression is based on Microsoft Ajax Minifier. Jasc can handle single or multiple files, will accept regular expressions to remove specific lines from the source code, and can also optimize the results by shrinking variable names and tweaking the source code. Compiled in Mono C# 3.0, runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.",
