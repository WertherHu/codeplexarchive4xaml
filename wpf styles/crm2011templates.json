To extend CRM and to have the same look and feel throughout the application, it&#39;s better to have a standard style templates that we can put into the CRM 2011 web resources. I have created a few templates that you can leverage to extend CRM 2011.<br /><br />This is the first version of the style templates, I have included three html forms which they are the main CRM form, main CRM area form and the lookup form.  I have uploaded screenshot of the templates on my blog. http://darrenliu.wordpress.com/<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
