Written in C&#35; and WPF.\n<h2>WPF On Screen Keyboard (Wosk) serves two purposes:</h2>\r<ul><li>To provide highly customizable on-screen keyboard</li>\n<li>To help learn WPF and allow even more customization for advanced users</li></ul>\n<img src=\"/projects/wosk/08688ef7-09fd-4673-bcfa-659428ec20cc\" alt=\"Wosk_thumb.jpg\" title=\"Wosk_thumb.jpg\" /><br /><a href=\"https://wosk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Screenshots&referringTitle=Home\">Screenshots</a>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\rConfiguration not implemented. One keyboard layout included.<br /><b>Global HotKey for hiding/showing the Wosk window: NumLock (currently hardcoded).</b>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\rWosk is a working application, but still an early version. Please forgive me any bugs or personal assumptions.<br />I am testing it on Samsung Q1U UMPC which has a couple of hardware keys - almost useless, but I use NumLock as a hardware hotkey for Wosk. I chose NumLock because I never use it on my keyboards, it is available on my UMPC and it does not interfere with the keys supported by current version of Wosk.<br />Wosk uses some Win32 API for sending keycodes and configuring UI window so it does not steal focus.<br /><img src=\"/projects/wosk/05662a66-e7db-4b50-a42b-0c7dd8841cd1\" alt=\"t_P1200032.jpg\" title=\"t_P1200032.jpg\" /><br /><a href=\"https://wosk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Screenshots&referringTitle=Home\">Screenshots</a>\n<h2>Join the project!</h2>\rI am just learning WPF and Wosk already helped me a lot.
