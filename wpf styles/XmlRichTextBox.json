Placing this code into production may require a lot more testing.<br /><br />The meat of the control is held in the XmlStateMachine.cs class which can be taken out and used to extend controls in MVC, ASP.NET or WPF.<br /><br />There is also a built-in context menu to Select All, Copy Text and Copy Rich Text by right clicking the control.<br /><br />NOTE: The control requires System.Xml.Linq to be referenced by the project.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/XmlRichTextBox/69b3c98c-cd72-4b2f-a07a-ed10af5a2474\" alt=\"Example.png\" title=\"Example.png\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
