Its goal is making the cost of a comment as close to zero as possible: easy commenting encourages thorough code reviews.<br /><br />Reviewing code in Malevich is easy indeed. A reviewer can see both the original as well as the new revision of a file in a browser. To comment on a line of code, he or she simply clicks on that line, and starts typing. Submitting comments makes them visible to the person who requested the code review, as well as to all other reviewers.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/Malevich/2bf6b5be-199d-41bf-bf5b-0a2b3935b0df\" alt=\"malevich&#32;-&#32;diff&#32;view.jpg\" title=\"malevich&#32;-&#32;diff&#32;view.jpg\" /><br /><br />Malevich is hosted on widely available Microsoft technologies and can be easily deployed on a small server or an individual workstation.<br /><br />Interested?
