There is an example provided in the source code.</li>\n<li>RandomizedCollectionView - allows you to bind to randomly chosen subset of items in the collection.</li>\n<li>SplitCollectionView - helps in scenarios when you have two lists of objects: assigned and available. For example it might be an user view, where you grant and revoke privilages (see code provided) or game weapon selection scenario (see the following table)</li></ul>\n<br /><table><tr><td>Available weapons</td><td>Chosen weapons</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Sword</td><td>Mace</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Dagger</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Axe</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Stick</td></tr></table><br /><br />\n<ul><li>MultiSplitCollectionView - similar to SplitCollectionView, but supports up to 3 source lists. In the example with user grants - this collection allows you to have available privilages split into three categories.</li></ul>\n<br /><table><tr><td>Available iron weapons</td><td>Available wooden weapons</td><td>Chosen weapons</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Sword</td><td>Stick</td><td>Mace</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Dagger</td><td> </td></tr>\n<tr><td>Axe</td><td> </td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
