Bringing the best of both worlds in terms of power, performance and safety.</p>\r\n<p>C&sup2;&nbsp;will make a terrific beginner's language thanks to it C#-like core paradigm.</p>\r\n<p>The assembled output of the compiler is going to be binary compatible with C/C&#43;&#43;.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some key points summarized:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>System programming language </li><li>Unmanaged - directly compiled into machine code </li><li>Object-oriented at its core: Classes, Methods, Properties, Fields.&nbsp;Delegates, Events&nbsp;and Interfaces.\r\n</li><li>C# syntax </li><li>Objects as values by default. </li><li>Reference-counted pointers (^). </li><li>Unsafe context: Standard pointers (*), arithmetics and manual memory&nbsp;management.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Some other goals:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Object-oriented runtime library - modeled on the .NET&nbsp;Base Class Library (BCL).\r\n</li><li>Binary compatibility with C/C&#43;&#43;. </li><li>Interoperability with C/C&#43;&#43;. </li></ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;To be explored in a possible future:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A bootstrapped compiler - written in the language itself. Enabling more advanced tooling.\r\n</li><li>Features from C#: Enumerable generators, Extension methods, Async etc. </li><li>IL metadata interface - to describe the code as well as&nbsp;permit dynamic linking and interoperability with .NET.\r\n</li><li>Other back-ends. </li></ul>\r\n<h2>Development</h2>\r\n<h3>Roadmap</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Prototype/Proof-of-concept in C# (In Progress)\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Turing-completeness </li></ol>\r\n</li><li>C&sup2; compiler - built in C#\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Basic libraries </li></ol>\r\n</li><li>C&sup2; compiler - built in&nbsp;C&sup2; </li></ol>\r\n<h3>Latest version</h3>\r\n<p>Check the <em>develop</em> branch for the latest version.</p>\r\n<h3>Participation</h3>\r\n<p>Do you want to contribute?
