It can be run from inside of Visual Studio or integrated into an MSBuild project. StyleCop has also been integrated into many third-party development tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>4.7.55 is compatible with:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015 </li><li>JetBrains ReSharper versions:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>5.1.3 (5.1.3000.12) </li><li>6.0 (6.0.2202.688) </li><li>6.1 (6.1.37.86) </li><li>6.1.1 (6.1.1000.82) </li><li>7.0.1 (7.0.1098.2760) </li><li>7.1.3 (7.1.3000.2254) </li><li>8.2 (8.2.3000.5176) </li><li>9.2 (103.0.0.0) - as an extension from the ReSharper gallery\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>NOTE: An error may be displayed when the extension is first installed, but everything should still work normally\r\n</li></ul>\r\n</li><li>10.0.2 (104.0.0.0) - as an extension from the ReSharper gallery\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>NOTE: An error may be displayed when the extension is first installed, but everything should still work normally\r\n</li></ul>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>Core Principles</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>StyleCop provides value by enforcing a common set of style rules for C# code. StyleCop will continue to ship with a single, consistent set of rules, with minimal rule configuration allowed. Developers can implement their own rules if they so choose.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>StyleCop ships with the ability to seamlessly integrate with Visual Studio, MSBuild, TFS, etc. Developers are free to implement custom code to integrate StyleCop into other development and tooling environments, as described in the SDK documentation.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
