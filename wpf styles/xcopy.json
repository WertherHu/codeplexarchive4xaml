Very simple, but I personally could not live without this!<br /><br />Note: this is an <b>additional</b> copy and paste mechanism, the windows clipboard is never touched. And <br />in my experience, this is what makes this infinitely better than autohotkey scripts which use the windows clipboard (of course, the drawback is that it&#39;s not system-wide).</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
