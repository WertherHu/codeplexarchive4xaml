You can also just use it as a Go board to play a game.  (For search purposes: goban, baduk, weiqi.)<br /><br /><i>The project has a Python version (IronPython/WPF required for UI), C#/WPF desktop version, and Windows 8 Windows App Store version.  The Python version is the farthest behind (see sgfpy\\notes.txt), and the WPF version is behind by a couple of features, also listed in notes.txt).  I use PTVS to hack on the IPy version.  I use Visual Studio for the C#/WPF and C#/WinRT versions.</i><br /><br />The Windows 8 app store page is <a href=\"http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/sgfeditor/4770d48e-0179-4ada-a7ed-8382c85d949a\">here</a>.<br /><br />Here&#39;s an image of the win8 app followed by an image of the WPF version (Surface screen res seems too high for uploading screen capture, but if you zoom your browser window, it looks better :-)):<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/sgfeditor/6337e66f-2620-4dc3-a3f3-fb821b18332a\" alt=\"screenshotwin8.png\" title=\"screenshotwin8.png\" /><br /><br /><br />and WPF version ...<br /><img src=\"/projects/sgfeditor/0fd4b06f-46d7-4be9-9716-88d70d7c84f3\" alt=\"capture.png\" title=\"capture.png\" /><br /><br /><br /><b><u>history/status/caveat</u>:</b>\n<ul><li>I started this as an IronPython project to play with WPF and the tooling that later became PTVS.  I then ported to C# for fun and to get ready to convert the WPF UI to Windows 8 WinRT UI.  </li>\n<li>The C# is mostly fine IMO, BUT\n<ol><li>It still reflects some python-isms (for example, comments refer to python<i>style</i>names, there is inadvertent mixed naming style, big static classes for stateless module scoped helper functions, few uses of &#39;dynamic&#39; instead of interfaces/generics/overloads) and </li>\n<li>While I have had one serious C# expert positively review architecture and code, the code style is not the Microsoft C# sample style.  I like K&amp;R style and more comments.</li></ol></li></ul>\n<br /><br /><b>From the Help command ...</b><br /><br />PLACING STONES AND ANNOTATIONS:<br />Click on board location to place alternating colored stones.<br />Shift click to place square annotations, ctrl click for triangles, and<br />alt click to place letter annotations.  If you click on an adornment location<br />twice (for example shift-click twice in one spot), the second click removes<br />the adornment.<br /><br />If the last move is a misclick (at the end of a branch), click the last move again to undo it.<br /><br />KEEPING FOCUS ON BOARD FOR KEY BINDINGS<br />Escape will always return focus to the board so that the arrow keys work<br />and are not swallowed by the comment editing pane.  Sometimes opening and<br />saving files leaves WPF in a weird state such that you must click somewhere<br />to fix focus.<br /><br />NAVIGATING MOVES IN GAME TREE<br />Right arrow moves to the next move, left moves to the previous, up arrow selects<br />another branch or the main branch, down arrow selects another branch, home moves<br />to the game start, and end moves to the end of the game following the currently<br />selected branches.  You can always click a node in the game tree graph.<br /><br />{[win8 version]}] If the current move has branches following it, the selected branch&#39;s first node has a<br />light grey square outlining it. Nodes that have comments have a light green<br />highlight, and the current node has a light blue highlight.<br /><br /><br />CREATING NEW FILES<br />The new button (or ctrl-n) prompts for game info (player names, board size,<br />handicap, komi) and creates a new game.  If the current game is dirty, this prompts<br />to save.<br /><br />OPENING EXISTING FILES<br />The open button (or ctrl-o) prompts for a .sgf file name to open.  If the current<br />game is dirty, this prompts to save.<br /><br />SAVING FILES, SAVE AS<br />The save button (or ctrl-s) saves to the associated file name if there is one;<br />otherwise it prompts for a filename.  If there is a filename, but the game state<br />is not dirty, then it prompts to save to a different filename (and tracks to the<br />new name).  To explicitly get save-as behaivor, use ctrl-alt-s.<br /><br />SAVING REVERSE VIEW<br />To save the game so that your opponent can review it from his point of view, use<br />ctrl-alt-f.  (Would have preferred ctrl-shift-s or alt-s, but WPF was difficult.)<br /><br />CUTTING MOVES/SUB-TREES AND PASTING<br />Delete or c-x cuts the current move (and sub tree), making the previous move the<br />current move.  C-v will paste a cut sub tree to be a next move after the current<br />move.  If the the sub tree has a move that occupies a board location that already<br />has a stone, you will not be able to advance past this position.<br /><br />MOVING BRANCHES<br />You can move branches up and down in the order in which they show up in the branch<br />combo, including changing what is the main line branch of the game.  To move a<br />a branch up, you must be on the first move of a branch, and then you can use<br />ctrl-uparrow, and to move a branch down, use ctrl-downarrow.<br /><br />PASSING<br />The Pass button or c-p will make a pass move.<br /><br />F1 produces this help.<br /><br />There is an auto save feature if Windows suspends the app and also every 30s.<br />Opening a file that has a newer auto save file prompts for which to open.  Launching<br />the app checks for an unnamed auto save file less than 12 hours old.<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
