It makes full use of the MVVM pattern. The project gives us a directory, called &quot;data&quot;, with a list of XML files from which we read in to. We read the data and display it in a graph based on the user&#39;s query.<br /><br />To use, you need to go to File-&gt;Open..., choose the directory where all the XML data is stored, and then play around with the application!<br /><br />Backend Developer: samlh<br />Frontend Developer: slezakattack</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
