It&#39;s developed in C&#35; using .NET Framework 3.5, WPF and WCF.<br /><br />As TableTop .NET cannot implement itself specific role-playing guides, specific addon system was provided to allow write game specific behaviors. The interface is planned to be used also by touch-screen driven devices as much as possible. <br />\n<h1>Software prerequisites</h1>\r\nTableTop .NET have the following prerequisites:<br />\n<ul><li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4</li></ul>\n<br />The software is compatible with x64 and x86 architectures.<br />MONO was not supported as it not allow .NET Framework 4 applications to run. Also, large use of WPF prevents this software to run over Unix systems without specific emulation.<br /><br /><br /><b><i>Feel free to send advices and implementation requests, as they will be discussed and implemented as possible</i></b><br /><br />\n<h2>Donations</h2>\r\nWe will appreciate donations to make this software grows and continue to develop.
