You can put ItemsSourceProvider into MultipleItemsControl to add multiple ItemsSources. You can also manually add more ItemsSources.)<br />2) DirectItemsControl (ItemsControl without the ContentPresentor capsule)<br />3) EnumEditor (EnumEditor is a special ComboBox style control that can present your Enum values and allow multiple selection.)<br />4) XAMLRootExtension (Binding to your XAMLRoot)<br />5) ClosableTabControl (TabControl with Close button tabs.)<br />6) MultiplyConverter (Perform simple multiply in a binding.)<br /><br />Enjoy and help improve if you like them!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
