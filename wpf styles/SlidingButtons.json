But, his approach requires the page developer to include all of the css and images in order to make the adapter work. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if that was all packaged away in a class library?<br /><br />That&#39;s what the Sliding Doors Button Adapter does for you. In addition to re-rendering the asp button as shown in the above article, I include some default button styles, found on <a href=\"http://msforge.net/blogs/janko/archive/2008/01/31/make-fancy-buttons-using-css-sliding-doors-technique.aspx\">this page</a>. By altering the CssClass property of the asp button, the page developer gets not only the new button format, but also the required css and images.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
