It&#39;s developed in C&#35; using WPF.<br /><br />XDraw provides a graphical editor for XAML vector graphics, which can be saved and loaded as Canvas or DrawingImage.<br />For full list of features see <a href=\"#features\">here</a>.<br /><br /><b>Planing for next Version has started</b><br />After some inspirational posts on the discussions board I&#39;ve actually started planing the next version of XDraw, which will actually be 2.0.<br />The key features will be a Visual Studio Plugin and modularization, which allows to reuse the editor in your own applications.<br />For more Informations see <a href=\"https://xdraw.codeplex.com/discussions/222792\">Doing it all over: XDraw 2.0</a> or <a href=\"https://xdraw.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=XDraw2_0_DesignDocs&referringTitle=Home\">XDraw 2.0 Design documentation</a>.<br /><br />Here is a little video of the new Brush editor (features like GradientStops still missing):<br /><a href=\"/projects/xdraw/f826e27b-0985-4f45-b972-1e72db5f40de\">BrushEditor.mp4</a> (about 1MB, the rectangle on the right side is a bit dissarranged, must be my recording software!?)<br /><br /><b>Please check out the new documentaion</b><br />It&#39;s still in the beginning but might help you already getting started with XDraw.<br /><br /><b>By the way: All icons in XDraw have been created with XDraw.</b><br />You can find them in the ImageDictionary.xaml (+.xdprj) file in source.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/xdraw/cf534b55-9485-4973-a7ca-4e1c22bd8b1c\" alt=\"XDraw_V1_1.png\" title=\"XDraw_V1_1.png\" /><br /><u>screenshot showing path editing and basic stroke and brush editor</u><br /><br /><a name=\"features\"></a>\n<h2>Features</h2>\r<table><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Status</th><th>Version</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Shape editing by drag and drop</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Basic brush editing</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Basic stroke editing</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Creating new shapes</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Support for rectangles</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Support for paths</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Support for ellipses</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Support for lines</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Save/load as Canvas</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Save/load as DrawingImage</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.0</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Support for text</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Copy&amp;Paste</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Change Z-order of shpes</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Zooming and scrolling</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Manage whole image libs as XAML resource files</td><td>done</td><td>V 1.1</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Rotating shapes</td><td>planed</td><td>?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Support for composed geometries (grouping)</td><td>planed</td><td>?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Enhanced gradient brush editing</td><td>paned</td><td>?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Enhanced brush editing</td><td>planed</td><td>?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Reusing brushes (Brush as XAML resources</td><td>planed</td><td>?</td></tr>\n<tr><td>t.b.c.</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr></table><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
