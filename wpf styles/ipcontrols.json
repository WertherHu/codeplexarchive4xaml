The content of the visual elements (such as the address itself) can be accessed (get/set) via a simple property. The IPv6 control automatically detects the kind of presentation which is currently used on the current platform, that means the setter routine understands both the following string formats:<br /><br />2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7344   (normal)<br /> vs.<br />2001:0db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:3.112.115.68   (hybrid)</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
