It is loosely coupled to the client application and communicates via an ICommand<br /><br />The directory browser is specifically targeted to WPF applications that use the Model View View-Model (MVVM) pattern.  It does not use, or require, anything in the WinForms name space.  There is a sample application included in this release.  It must be built targeting 3.5 minimally.<br /><img src=\"/projects/tyburnwpfdbc/26ce62ed-3838-4ac4-8a72-690d8641f5a2\" alt=\"db.jpg\" title=\"db.jpg\" /><br /><br />Some of the features in this control are shown in the image below...<br /><img src=\"/projects/tyburnwpfdbc/2e47e1eb-2a96-4dd7-9264-dd7227e1270a\" alt=\"dbmarked.jpg\" title=\"dbmarked.jpg\" /><br />As shown, there are two major regions: a list of &#39;special folders&#39; and a grid of folders in the current directory.  Both of these respond to double clicks.  In the top left, there are the familiar &#39;back/forward&#39; buttons and a DDL which presents the navigation history.  The navigation history is static so each visit to this control persists prior browsing activity.  An open DDL is shown below...<br /><img src=\"/projects/tyburnwpfdbc/171920cc-3f21-4764-9939-8c0532f4c845\" alt=\"dbddl.jpg\" title=\"dbddl.jpg\" /><br />The control also permits the direct entry of text for direct navigation, this is shown below...<br /><img src=\"/projects/tyburnwpfdbc/f23972e1-f231-4e91-9d47-ef76dbbcb5e3\" alt=\"dbbind.jpg\" title=\"dbbind.jpg\" /><br />And finally, the image below shows how the control appears in a WPF application.  There is a binding between the application&#39;s View-Model and the control, and this is fired when the user clicks either the &#39;Select&#39; or &#39;Cancel&#39; button.  For more information, see the sample included in this release.<br /><img src=\"/projects/tyburnwpfdbc/ff3262d1-5a65-41ac-bf0a-cb9802569731\" alt=\"dbxaml.jpg\" title=\"dbxaml.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
