The source code included in this project are 2 fold. ONE, for the onboard vehicle - such as Communication Model, etc written using Arduino language. TWO, is a C# based Command module that runs on a Windows\r\n PC that communicates w/ the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagi Punyamurthula</p>\r\n<p><strong>PS:</strong> Many Thanks to the Arduino Forum for helping me identify my limitations and help educate me to resolve the issues.
