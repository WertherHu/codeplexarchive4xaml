Since the game can easily shift don&#39;t feel too sure of your victory and relax a bit, because suddenly you can loose very fast.<br /><br />As a player you control either the Oil Barrel or the Flower sack. As you fill the board with either oil stains or flowers your opponent does the same. If you have the lowest number of tiles filled your health drops, and it drops faster if you&#39;re far behind.<br /><br />You have a maximum of 10 flowers or 10 oil stains but can refill at the Oiltower and at the wheelbarrow <img src=\"/projects/klimakonflikt/0e611523-9dcc-4a40-b657-ee8d725caa2e\" alt=\"WheelBarrel.png\" title=\"WheelBarrel.png\" />.<br /><br />Meanwhile the fire&#39;s <img src=\"/projects/klimakonflikt/778172e7-60db-414a-8d1a-e3c1d82efde1\" alt=\"ild0004.png\" title=\"ild0004.png\" /> rage and if you are so unfortunate to encounter one of the 2 fire&#39;s your ammo (the oil stains or flowers) drops to zero.<br /><br />Go to the Documentation Tab to read more, or download it now<br /><br />There is also an <a href=\"https://klimakonflikt.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=experimental&referringTitle=Home\">experimental Silverlight</a> edition, but it needs huge optimizations to run smoothly.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
