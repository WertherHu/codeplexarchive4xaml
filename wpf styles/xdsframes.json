The names you should configure are xsshost and xsschild, then configure IIS with two sites - one for http://xsshost:8090 and http://xsschild:8091*<br />\n<ul><li>You can use whatever you like, so long as they are seperate names/ports to simulate cross domain, but you will need to change the code to work with different names.</li></ul>\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
