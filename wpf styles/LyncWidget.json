Today we have a new stable version focused on Lync 2013. We offer this product in combination with professional services to install and configure it in your website/portal. You need a Lync 2013 on-premise server (does not work yet with Office 365).\n\nImplementation projects typically cost between 2800 to 4000 EUR excl VAT.\n\nMore info on our tariffs can be found on: <a href=\"http://www.orbitone.com/en/how-we-do-it/#1463\">http://www.orbitone.com/en/how-we-do-it/#1463</a></code></pre>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
