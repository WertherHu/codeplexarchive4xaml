It&#39;s compatible with WPF and Silverlight data binding. It&#39;s developed in C&#35;.<br /><br />We&#39;ve been using MetaProperties for over a year within our software team at the company where I work, and it&#39;s helped us write more reliable, event driven code faster than we would otherwise have been able to. The source code has been available on my website since May 2009, but I finally decided to put it on CodePlex in March 2010. CodePlex is now its permanent home.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
