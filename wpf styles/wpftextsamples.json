Some are taken from MSDN documentation.<br /><br />My personal special interest is in ruby (a.k.a. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana/\">Furigana</a>) support. But I also want to collect more samples about FlowDocuments.<br /><br />Additional support is needed!!!<br /><br />TODO:<br /> - add more examples<br /> - collect and report bugs</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
