This is for all the people who want to learn to use MVC 4 and Knockout but need sample code to understand it faster. Talking from experience there is DEFINITELY a lack of samples out\r\n there, so I'm offering this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Based on code by Steve Sanderson:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2010/07/12/editing-a-variable-length-list-knockout-style/\">http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2010/07/12/editing-a-variable-length-list-knockout-style/</a></p>\r\n<p>The table HTML and bare framework knockout code is his work, but the validation code was added by me, and I'll keep adding more, until I'm satisfied the sample is good enough. I'm a perfectionist so it may take a while ;)</p>\r\n<p>This code will be extended - stay tuned!</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Scott T.
