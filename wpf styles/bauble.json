As a launcher, it contains an animated list  application icons, and will open their program on click.<br />\n<h2>Project Roots</h2>\r<a href=\"http://www.rocketdock.com\">RocketDock</a> is an amazing piece of well written software. Unfortunately it  is unsupported on Windows 7 64bit. Development has slowed to the point where it is reasonable to say there likely will not be another release for it in the near future, and many of the plugins written for it have significant bugs and are no longer supported by their authors.<br /><br />Bauble attempts to be a functional replacement for RocketDock. There are many areas where Bauble does not meet this goal yet, but we are working to add features so that we can reach functional parity.<br />\n<h2>Themes</h2>\rBauble does not support RocketDock themes, but does provide a theming interface of its own. There are currently two themes:<br />\n<h3>Crystal Theme</h3>\r<img src=\"http://www.cyberknet.net/images/bauble%20crystal%20screenshot.png\" /><br />\n<h3>Crystal 3D Theme</h3>\r<img src=\"http://www.cyberknet.net/images/bauble%20crystal3D%20screenshot.png\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
