Both reveal and fade-in/fade-out effects are provided.<br /><br />The module exposes all settings for the News Ticker script and creates and manages multiple news items which may be custom or creation date sequenced and displayed indefinitely or for a period of time defined by a start and end date.<br /><br />All management controls (datetime picker, spinner, etc.) are open-source jQuery plugins or jQueryUI widgets rather than Telerik. Custom sequencing of news items is setup via drag-and-drop of grid rows or clicking of up/down arrows without post-back.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
