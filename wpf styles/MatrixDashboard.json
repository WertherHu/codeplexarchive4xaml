In the example supplied in the source code, it tracks the activity of file transfers. <br /><br />Basically a short string representing an object being transferred is displayed in white vertically and scrolls downward, while random green characters trail behind and to the side. <br /><br />A short video of the control / gauge in action is at <a href=\"http://youtu.be/_2ys7-kSh14\">http://youtu.be/_2ys7-kSh14</a><br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/MatrixDashboard/c14c714d-fb5b-45aa-aafb-35da13a73c40\" alt=\"Modern_UI_Gauges.png\" title=\"Modern_UI_Gauges.png\" /><br />\n<h2>Details</h2>\rUse of a background worker is made to update the telemetry object so that the GUI does not look jerky or slow down. <br />\n<h2>Background</h2>\rInspiration for this comes from several other Matrix projects that were Console based, but this uses the WPF System.Windows.Media framework instead. <br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
