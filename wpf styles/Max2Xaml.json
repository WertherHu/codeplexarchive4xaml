This is a set of scripts to export your models from 3D Studio Max directly to Xaml and ready to use in your WPF projects.<br /><br />This project is in an <b><i>very early</i></b> alpha state. So everything will change and a lot of bugs will be found. But, feel free to give it a try. <br />\n<h2><b><i>Quick &#39;n short tutorial</i></b></h2>\rExport from 3D Studio:\n<ul><li>start 3D studio and open your model </li>\n<li>click <i>MAXScript</i> menu -&gt; run script...</li>\n<li>browse to &quot;main.ms&quot; and run it</li>\n<li>click export and give filename</li>\n<li>select all and copy contents in memory</li></ul>\nRunning the example:\n<ul><li>open the Wpf3dExample project in visual studio</li>\n<li>paste the xaml in Data3dDictionary (overwriting everything!)</li>\n<li>compile and run</li></ul>\n<br />Maxim posted a great and detailed tutorial on his blog on how to get started using the exporter:<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/maxim/archive/2009/03/31/daily-tip-how-to-import-3d-model-to-wpf-from-3d-max.aspx\">http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/maxim/archive/2009/03/31/daily-tip-how-to-import-3d-model-to-wpf-from-3d-max.aspx</a>.<br /><br /><b>Friday, March 06 2009</b> =&gt; <i>project creation</i><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
