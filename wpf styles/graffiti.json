When the source control system in this project is migrated to Github - I will be pushing all changes to both repositories.<br />\t<br />Graffiti will only ever include rendering tasks and is not meant to be a catch-all game engine. For example: A 2D skeletal animation framework (to be released soon) will sit on top of Graffiti, not be a part of it. Most features you can think of have been thoughtfully omitted because they don&#39;t fit into the narrow range of functionality that Graffiti is meant to support. It is entirely possible that I missed something - so if you can think of any omissions do let me know.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
