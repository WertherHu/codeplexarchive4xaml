Separation of concerns and loose coupling patterns are used to provide an easy to implement and extensible solution that fits well in an MVVM paradigm.<br /><br />FlyoutManager depends on the Prism library, using Unity extensions although it could easily be modified to use an alternative DI container.  Obviously MahApps.Metro is also a dependency of the project.<br /><br />Available via Nuget Package Manager as Bulldog.FlyoutManager<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
