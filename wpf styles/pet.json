It consists of three parts:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Process provider </li><li>Tool provider </li><li>Process-Tool interchange model </li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<a title=\"PET architecture\" href=\"http://i3.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=pet&DownloadId=148583\"><img title=\"PET Architecture Overview\" src=\"http://i3.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=pet&DownloadId=148582\" alt=\"PET Architecture Overview\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <em>interchange model</em> defines the data structures used by the generator system. During its processing PET uses\r\n<em>process providers</em> to read process models and <em>tool providers</em> for result generation.<br>\r\nA process provider abstracts the concrete process. Its job is to filter and map the process' data into the interchange format. Tool providers contain the processing's intelligence, so to say. They are responsible for collecting all data, transforming them and\r\n for providing the coupling to the particular tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll providers are realized as plug-ins. The generator tools load them automatically, e.g. for processes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img title=\"Process provider panel\" src=\"http://i3.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=pet&DownloadId=68840\" alt=\"Process provider panel\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving selected an available process, the next step is to select the target tool for the enactment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img title=\"Process provider panel\" src=\"http://i3.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=pet&DownloadId=68841\" alt=\"Process provider panel\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently the platform supports following processes:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.v-modell-xt.de\">V-Modell XT<span>&nbsp;</span></a> </li></ul>\r\nand following tools:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Microsoft Sharepoint --&gt; <a href=\"/wikipage?title=SharePoint&referringTitle=Home\">\r\nSharePoint</a> </li><li>Microsoft Team Foundation Server --&gt; <a href=\"/wikipage?title=TFS&referringTitle=Home\">\r\nTFS</a> </li><li>Microsoft Office Word 2007/2008 --&gt; <a href=\"/wikipage?title=Office Word&referringTitle=Home\">\r\nOffice Word</a> </li></ul>\r\n<h1>Further Material</h1>\r\nThe following is an overview over further material regarding the Process Enactment Tool Framework.<br>\r\n<h2>How to build PET</h2>\r\nBuilding the PET assemblies yourself is quite easy. Core, wizard, the V-Modell XT as well as the TFS provider should build right away : )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to build the SharePoint and the DocX tool providers, please read the following notes. Do not need them? Simply disable the according projects within the Visual Studio solution.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>SharePoint provider</em>: Before you can compile the provider assembly it is necessary to build the separate solution\r\n<em>Tum.CollabXT.SharePoint.Site</em> which contains <em>CollabXTStrings.dll</em> and\r\n<em>CollabXTWebParts.dll</em>. Furthermore these projects reference <em>Microsoft.SharePoint.dll</em>. You can most easily obtain it from a server running Windows SharePoint services (WSS).\r\n</li><li><em>DocX provider</em>: To build this assembly you need to get the <em>DocumentFormat.OpenXML.dll</em> from Microsoft (it is part of the Open XML SDK 2.0; there is no need to install the whole SDK, just extract the needed file from the installer via\r\n<em>msiexex</em>). Put this library under <em>Tum.CollabXT.DocxGen\\Resources</em>.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<h2>Historical Versions</h2>\r\nThis project is an advancement over the previously published projects <a href=\"http://collabxt.codeplex.com/\">\r\nCollabXT SP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/VModellXTTFS\">CollabXT TFS</a>. Both projects are now outdated and replaced by the integrated Process Enactment Tool Framework.<br>\r\n<h2>Research Papers</h2>\r\nQuite a lot of research publications have been published around this project. A selection of relevant, English publications is:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>M. Kuhrmann, G. Kalus: <a href=\"http://www4.in.tum.de/publ/papers/kuhrkal08c.pdf\">\r\nProviding Integrated Development Processes for Distributed Development Environments</a>\r\n</li><li>M. Kuhrmann, G. Kalus, N. Diernhofer: <a href=\"http://www.actapress.com/Abstract.aspx?paperId=32514\">\r\nGenerating Tool-based Process-Environments from Formal Process Models Descriptions - Concepts, Experiences and Samples</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n</div>\r\n",
