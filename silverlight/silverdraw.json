  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\">Silverdraw is realtime white board that can sync information between various participants, using Silverlight + WCF Polling Duplex.<br /><br />Presently this is a working POC implementation<br /><br />Users can draw together in the white board, and may chat each other. Here is a quick screen shot of the client running in two different browsers. These are the steps to start<br />\n<h2>How to start</h2>\r\n1 - Read this intro post in my blog<br /><a href=\"http://amazedsaint.blogspot.com/2009/11/silverlight-wcf-duplex-services.html\">http://amazedsaint.blogspot.com/2009/11/silverlight-wcf-duplex-services.html</a><br /><br />2- Take a live demo here - It may or may not work, the server is a bit leaky<br /><a href=\"http://silverdraw.com\">http://silverdraw.com</a><br /><br />3 - Read this codeproject article to help you understand the source<br /><a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/silverdraw.aspx\">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/silverdraw.aspx</a><br /><br />4 - Click downloads to grab the source<br />\n<h2>Join and contribute. Future Ideas</h2>\r\n<ul><li>Registration and user authentication upon login (probably using asp.net membership providers)</li>\n<li>Dynamic loading of shapes using MEF </li>\n<li>Evolve the application to a full fledged prototyping tool - similar functionalities as in balsamiq.com/</li>\n<li>Multiple drawing rooms + users can join rooms upon invitation </li>\n<li>Persist the messages drawing back and forth - so that we can replay the activity as in google wave, and pump the drawing data so far to a user up on connect. </li></ul>\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
