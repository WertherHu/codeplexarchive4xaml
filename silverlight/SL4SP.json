The goal of the blueprints is to give you some guidance on how to integrate Silverlight applications with SharePoint. There are many possibilities here, and we&#39;ve put together just a few to get you started. <br /><br />Note: Make sure you amend the web.config file in the root folder of your SharePoint site to allow for your Silverlight application. We discuss this and provide a link to a sample web.config file, in the FAQ document located on the Beta 2 Releases tab.<br /><br />I added the last of the RTM files today, the colleague viewer and the custom navigation, along with a Beta 2 to RTM change document. You can also access the Beta 2 samples should you need them from the Releases tab. <br /><br />For more information about Software-plus-Services Blueprints please visit out main landing page on Channel9: <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/blueprints\">http://channel9.msdn.com/blueprints</a><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
