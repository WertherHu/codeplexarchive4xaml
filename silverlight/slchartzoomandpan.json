The control is great, however there is no real zoom functionality which is a problem.<br />Here is an example given where the charts template is moidified to provide a ScrollViewer wrapper for the chart panel which allows you to zoom the whole chart and scroll around it:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.silverlight.net/content/samples/sl4/toolkitcontrolsamples/run/default.html\">http://www.silverlight.net/content/samples/sl4/toolkitcontrolsamples/run/default.html</a><br /><br />DataVisualization -&gt; Zoom<br /><br />The big problem with this is that the axes are scrolled with the chart surface, which is not the desired effect.<br /><br /><b>Solution</b><br />I thought about this for a while and came up with a solution without modifying the source.<br /><br />It was clear that the problem stemmed from the fact that the axes were not independent of the plot surface, but this could be easily solved by using a grid with 3 plot surfaces to hold the main plot surface and X and Y axes:<br /><br /><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MZybqxKYw1c/TVKeW8kljlI/AAAAAAAAAAM/-RqZBOBRUJo/s320/plot.bmp\" /><br /><br />The scroll behaviour of the axes plot surfaces can be tied to the main plot surface to make it appear as though they were one piece!ï»¿<br /><br /><a href=\"http://geoffwebbercross.blogspot.com/2011/02/silverlight-4-toolkit-zoom-and-pan.html\">http://geoffwebbercross.blogspot.com/2011/02/silverlight-4-toolkit-zoom-and-pan.html</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
