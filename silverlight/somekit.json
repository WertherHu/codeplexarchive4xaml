Asynchronous as well as synchronous wrappers for everything using normal HOFs. Json and Xml serialization wrappers provided - works using simple POCO serialization with either\r\n the DataContractSerializer or the DataContractJsonSerializer. No complicated type-discovery supported - decorate your type using [KnownType] if necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Basic authentication supported. Targets are: full .NET 4, Silverlight 4 and Phone 7 silverlight. Should work fine for XNA as well.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",
