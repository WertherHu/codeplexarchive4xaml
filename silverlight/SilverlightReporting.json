Instead, this is a set of code you can build upon to create short (2-5 page) reports from your Silverlight applications.<br /><br />Currently the sample consists of the full source code of a simple report writer. It includes:\n<ul><li>automatic pagination</li>\n<li>support for line items of varying height</li>\n<li>total page count</li>\n<li>templating</li>\n<li>page headers and footers</li>\n<li>report footer with support for calculated fields</li>\n<li>events to allow hooking into printing at various stages</li></ul>\n<br />It does not include grouping, sections, cover pages, or other reporting tasks better suited to a more complete report writer.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a sample, printed using the XPS print driver in Windows 7. Note the headers and footers, page numbering, variable-height rows etc.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/SilverlightReporting/bdce3cc8-5a37-432a-b085-3f734a16fa89\" alt=\"pmb_sample_report.jpg\" title=\"pmb_sample_report.jpg\" /><br />\n<h2>Additional Information</h2>\rFor additional information on the two posts that created this project, see:<br />\n<h4>Creating a Simple Report Writer in Silverlight 4 - Pete Brown</h4>\r<a href=\"http://10rem.net/blog/2010/05/09/creating-a-simple-report-writer-in-silverlight-4\">http://10rem.net/blog/2010/05/09/creating-a-simple-report-writer-in-silverlight-4</a><br />\n<h4>Making Printing Easier in Silverlight 4</h4>\r<a href=\"http://www.davidpoll.com/2010/04/16/making-printing-easier-in-silverlight-4/\">http://www.davidpoll.com/2010/04/16/making-printing-easier-in-silverlight-4/</a><br />\n<h4>Silverlight 5 in Action </h4>\r(chapter 31 is on printing and builds a simple report similar to the code here)<br /><a href=\"http://manning.com/pbrown2/\">http://manning.com/pbrown2/</a><br /><br />\n<h2>System Requirements</h2>\rRequires Silverlight 4 and Visual Studio 2010.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
