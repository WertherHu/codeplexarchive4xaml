So the act of giving zakat means purifying one&#39;s wealth to gain Allah&#39;s blessings to make it grow in goodness.<br /><br />Zakat is the religious payment made by a Muslim from his wealth or income or business or crops or animals in the form of money or crops or animals, according to a certain rate (2.5% or 5% or 10% depending on the type of wealth or income), paid to the zakath authority of the country for the purpose of distribution to the eligible categories. Zakat can be paid directly to the needy if there is no zakat management authority.<br /><br />The project aims at showcasing the various features and implementations of the Silverlight technology<br />\n<ul><li>Animations and Storyboards</li>\n<li>Content Controls</li>\n<li>Child Windows</li>\n<li>Data Binding</li>\n<li>Keyboard Interaction</li>\n<li>Styles</li></ul>\n<br />Have a peek at <a href=\"http://zakat.adnan-rashid.com/\">http://zakat.adnan-rashid.com/</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
