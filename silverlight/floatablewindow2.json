In my opinion, this is essential for creating large scale applications, with a lot of data that requires comparison. The taskbar demo, will provide just that.<br /><br /><b>New features</b><br /><br />An optional minimise button<br />Minimise event handler<br />Minimise and Maximise Window states and animations<br /><br />A demo project featuring a taskbar and how to use it in conjunction with the extended floatable window (effectively creating an MDI environment)<br /><br /><b>Credits</b><br /><br />I would like to thank Tim Hueur for the original work done on the Floatable Window, see his CodePlex project page here: <a href=\"http://floatablewindow.codeplex.com/\">http://floatablewindow.codeplex.com/</a><br />His blog posting regarding this control is available here: <br /><a href=\"http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/05/10/silverlight-childwindow-non-modal-refactor.aspx\">http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/05/10/silverlight-childwindow-non-modal-refactor.aspx</a><br /><br />I hope you all find this useful<br /><br /><i><b>Please note: All of this was done in Visual Studio 2010 and Targets Silverlight 4</b></i></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
