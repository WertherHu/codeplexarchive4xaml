This way you can fully control the resize element.<br />If you attach the behavior to an element, this element wil become &quot;draggable&quot;, but what it really does is calculating the mousechange and adds/substracts the delta to the width/height of the selected element.<br /><br />The properties of this behavior fully works with Blend. Designtime attributes have been added so picking the related element is using the elementpicker from Blend.<br /><br />Screenshot of the sampleapplication:<br /><img src=\"http://www.vassagoindustries.com/ResizeDragBehavior.PNG\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
