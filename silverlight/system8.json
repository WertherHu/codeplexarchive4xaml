We have calibration method that has 8 unkowns and 8 equations - and a bunch of assumptions that go into those equations. The code here is an attempt to build a tool that allows one to interactively explore System 8&#39;s behavior using Silverlight.<br /><br />I&#39;ll put up a link when I get it served from somewhere.<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
