Separate (possibly invisible) Silverlight application could serve as a Mediator or, as shown in this sample, Mediator could be one of these applications interacting with each other as long as others know its name. Mediator doesn&#39;t have to know anything about other Silverlight applications communicating through it but merely expose and register itself on the page. <br /><br /><img src=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/photos/ales/images/9145568/original.aspx\" /><br /><br />This sample is compatible with SharePoint 2007 and can help in implementing Mediator design pattern with SharePoint web parts.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
