  "Title": "PolyGraph3D 3D runtime engine for Silverlight 1.0",
  "Description": "This is a basic 3D scene graph engine that provides the essential mechanics of displaying 3-dimensional objects in a 2-dimensional viewport using Silverlight 1.0 (3D objects are drawn into any existing Canvas element). This project is 100% cross-browser JavaScript (I.E. and FireFox confirmed - others untested).\n\nPolyGraph3D has many basic features of a typical 3D engine, including polyhedral hierarchies, positioning/scaling/rotation, movable camera, and multiple brushes.\n\nFeatures that are notably missing, and probably not possible, include image/video texture brushes (or any form of traditional shaders). lighting effects, and smooth surfaces (nurbs, subdivision surfaces, etc).",

Because that simply is not a cool thing to do.<br /><br />If you have 3D programming experience and know JavaScript really well, then I welcome you to offer your assistance in making this project better. Silverlight experience is a bonus - but not really required since only a small portion of the code actually deals with the Silverlight interaction.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
