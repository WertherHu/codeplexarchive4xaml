This must be done before making any API calls.</li>\n<li>The classes are arranged in a very similar way to the original toodledo api so refer to the online documentation <a href=\"http://api.toodledo.com/2/index.php\">http://api.toodledo.com/2/index.php</a></li></ol>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\rThe account.GetKey method will cache the key for 3.5 hours if isolated storage is enabled.  So it is safe to call this multiple times without worrying about the limit of 10 calls per hour.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
