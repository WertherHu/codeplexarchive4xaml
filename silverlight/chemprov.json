  "Description": "The Chemical Process Visualizer (ChemProV) is a new educational software environment that supports the construction of process flow diagrams and corresponding material balance equations. Unlike powerful commercial environments like HYSYS, which solve material balance problems automatically, ChemProV is specifically designed to help students learn how to solve material balance problems. It does this by scaffolding the problem-solving process: As students work, ChemProV generates dynamic feedback messages that alert students to errors in their diagrams and equations, and provide hints on how the errors can be addressed.\r\n\r\nChemProV is being developed in C# and Silverlight. You can always access the most recent version of ChemProV at http://helplab.org/apps/chemprov/. ",
