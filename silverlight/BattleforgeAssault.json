Once the framework is in place, most of the work will be writing the individual cards. If you are not a member of the development team and happened to stumble your way here looking for something useful, I would suggest moving on for now. That is unless you have a very strong desire to work with a couple lax devs who may never have anything really working and spend more time talking architecture than getting things done. If that&#39;s you, feel free to contact Bejumi for more info on the project.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
