  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\"><h2>Overview</h2>\rSilverlight Audio Player is a simple audio player that can be used for playing back one or more audio files. It currently supports two styles of player. The first plays a single file and is based on the visual design of the <a href=\"http://wpaudioplayer.com/\">WordPress audio player</a>. The second allows you to play multiple files.<br />\n<h2>Installation</h2>\rYou need the AudioPlayer.xap file, and optionally an XML playlist file. Once you have those, you can<br />load the Silverlight application in the same way you would any other. Remember to set up the size appropriately,<br />and pass in the MP3 file Url or Playlist Url in the Initparams (see below).  By convention, Visual Studio likes<br />XAP files to be stored in a ClientBin folder. You do not need to do this, and if you don&#39;t, you will need to adjust the<br />relative paths from the examples shown below (i.e. no need for ..\\ on your Urls).<br />\n<h2>Using the Single Player</h2>\rTo use the single player, simply pass init params following the to your silverlight object. The single player should be sized 295 pixels wide and 30 pixels high.<br />    <br /><b>InitParams:</b> <i>Url=http://www.mydomain.com/audio/song-1.mp3,Artist=Artist Name,Title=Song title</i><br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/slaudioplayer/f75483ff-76f2-4dbc-a35f-a8dfe4bcdb63\" alt=\"slaudioplayer30oct2009.png\" title=\"slaudioplayer30oct2009.png\" /><br /><br /><b>Try it out:</b><br /><br /><object data=\"data:application/x-silverlight-2,\" type=\"application/x-silverlight-2\" style=\"height:30px;width:295px;\"><param name=\"source\" value=\"http://www.wordandspirit.co.uk/software/AudioPlayer.xap\"></param><param name=\"windowless\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"initParams\" value=\"Path=http://herdingcode.com/wp-content/uploads/HerdingCode-0063-Victory-in-Software-Development-with-K-Scott-Allen.mp3,Title=Herding Code Episode 63:Victory in Software Development with K Scott Allen\"></param><param name=\"minRuntimeVersion\" value=\"5.0.61118.0\"></param><param name=\"autoUpgrade\" value=\"true\"></param><p>You need to install Microsoft Silverlight to view this content. <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=149156&v=5.0.61118.0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Get Silverlight!<br /><img src=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=108181\" alt=\"Get Microsoft Silverlight\" style=\"border-style:none;\" /></a></p></object><iframe style=\"visibility:hidden;height:0;width:0;border-width:0;\"></iframe><br />\n<h2>Using the Multiple Player</h2>\rThe multi-player is still a work in progress. To launch the player with multiple files, you need to point it at a playlist. A playlist is<br />an XML file containing the Url, Artist and Title for each track you wish to play.<br /><br /><pre>\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;\n&lt;playlist&gt;\n  &lt;audiofile url=&quot;http://www.wordandspirit.co.uk/blog/audio/01-opposition-and-joy.mp3&quot; title=&quot;Opposition and Joy&quot; artist=&quot;Mark Heath&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;audiofile url=&quot;http://www.wordandspirit.co.uk/blog/audio/you-have-always-given.mp3&quot; title=&quot;You have always given&quot; artist=&quot;Mark Heath&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;audiofile url=&quot;http://www.wordandspirit.co.uk/blog/audio/dont-look-at-me.mp3&quot; title=&quot;Don&#39;t Look at Me&quot; artist=&quot;Mark Heath&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;audiofile url=&quot;http://www.wordandspirit.co.uk/blog/audio/holy-spirit-will-you-be.mp3&quot; title=&quot;Holy Spirit Will You Be&quot; artist=&quot;Mark Heath&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/playlist&gt;\n</pre><br /><br /><b>InitParams:</b> <i>Playlist=../MyPlaylist.xml</i><br /><img src=\"/projects/slaudioplayer/6385de99-db76-4eed-8f3e-b62a4768333e\" alt=\"sl-multi-player.png\" title=\"sl-multi-player.png\" /><br />\n<h2>Project News</h2>\r<b>1 Apr 2008</b><br />The Single and Multi player controls are basically working now, but need a little bit of visual tidy-up before we make our first beta release.
