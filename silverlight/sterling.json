You shouldn&#39;t have to change your classes just to persist them. (No awkward mapping from a class model to a relational database model).</li>\n<li>Lightweight. As of this writing, the DLL for Sterling is under 85 Kb. No one needs to bloat their project for something as simple as persisting data.</li>\n<li>Flexible. While the core is light, Sterling is designed to handle any serialization task and make it ultra-easy to query databases using LINQ-to-Objects.</li>\n<li>Portable. Sterling runs equally well on the desktop/server .NET framework, Silverlight, and Windows Phone.</li></ul>\nView the full <a href=\"https://sterling.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Features&referringTitle=Home\">Features</a> list.<br /><br /><b>Important Note from Jeremy Likness</b> <br /><br />Using Sterling comes with a trade-off. This product is maintained by a very small team - mostly Jeremy Likness with some assistance - so there is no guaranteed turnaround time for bug-fixes and there is no support hotline. That is the risk: defects may exist, and there is no guaranteed resolution. The reward is an out-of-the-box tool that makes saving and serializing objects very fast, easy, and straightforward. To further remove any barriers to use, I purposefully make two decisions with this project: first, you have 100% uncompromised access to the source at no cost, and second, you have full rights to take the source, modify it, fix it, or use it however you see fit within your own projects, at your own risk, against with no charge. There is no commercial fee for this project. I hope that this risk/reward model works for you and I also look forward to anyone open to joining our team to help support this product through future releases. <br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br /><img src=\"http://jeremylikness.com/signature.gif\" /><br /><br />The current stable release is <a href=\"https://sterling.codeplex.com/releases/view/102554\">Sterling OODB v1.6.2</a> .

This is how the entire Sterling database (including indexes and table definitions) compares on disk to other popular serialization methods when saving 2,000 contact records:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/sterling/19e61cc8-b6f9-49db-b934-d6cf2314717b\" alt=\"sizeondisk.png\" title=\"sizeondisk.png\" /><br /><br />Sterling is fast. The speed of serialization and deserialization is comparable to other methods despite the overhead of maintaining keys and indexes. The keys and indexes enable blazing fast LINQ to Object queries over Sterling records. In this example, the speed to serialize 2,000 contact records, deserialize them, then deserialize a subset of records based on a query to find all contacts with a last name starting with &quot;L&quot; is compared:<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/sterling/9e3bf8ef-787c-4a9d-a544-ca17f5fae557\" alt=\"sterlingspeed.png\" title=\"sterlingspeed.png\" /><br /><br /><b>Follow Sterling on Twitter</b><br /><br />Use the official Sterling tag: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23sterlingdb\">#SterlingDB</a><br /><br /><b>Who&#39;s Using It?</b> <br /><br />Check out this <a href=\"http://sterling.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=245116\">Discussion Thread</a> to read who is using Sterling and how.

Visit the <a href=\"http://sterling.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic\">Issue Tracker</a> to view, vote for and add your own feature requests!</b><br /><br /><b>I Want Details!</b><br /><br />In short, here&#39;s all it takes to define a table with an integer key and a string index: <br /><br /><div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">protected</span> <span style=\"color:Blue;\">override</span> List&lt;ITableDefinition&gt; RegisterTables()\n{\n   <span style=\"color:Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color:Blue;\">new</span> List&lt;ITableDefinition&gt;\n      {   CreateTableDefinition&lt;MyContact, <span style=\"color:Blue;\">int</span>&gt;(c =&gt; c.Id)\n                               .WithIndex&lt;MyContact, <span style=\"color:Blue;\">string</span>, <span style=\"color:Blue;\">int</span>&gt;(<span style=\"color:#A31515;\">&quot;Contact_Email&quot;</span>, c =&gt; c.Email)\n      };\n}\r\n</pre></div><br />Note the indexes always contain the key. This is because Sterling will lazy-load the actual entity. You can query over indexes and keys using LINQ to Objects, and only de-serialize when you need the value.<br /><br />Here is an example of a complex query from the reference application:<br /><br /><div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">return</span> <span style=\"color:Blue;\">from</span> n <span style=\"color:Blue;\">in</span> CurrentFoodDescription.Nutrients\n        <span style=\"color:Blue;\">join</span> nd <span style=\"color:Blue;\">in</span>\n            SterlingService.Current.Database.Query&lt;NutrientDefinition, <span style=\"color:Blue;\">string</span>, <span style=\"color:Blue;\">string</span>, <span style=\"color:Blue;\">int</span>&gt;(\n                FoodDatabase.NUTR_DEFINITION_UNITS_DESC)\n            <span style=\"color:Blue;\">on</span> n.NutrientDefinitionId <span style=\"color:Blue;\">equals</span> nd.Key\n        <span style=\"color:Blue;\">join</span> nd2 <span style=\"color:Blue;\">in</span>\n            SterlingService.Current.Database.Query&lt;NutrientDefinition, <span style=\"color:Blue;\">int</span>, <span style=\"color:Blue;\">int</span>&gt;(\n                FoodDatabase.NUTR_DEFINITION_SORT)\n            <span style=\"color:Blue;\">on</span> nd.Key <span style=\"color:Blue;\">equals</span> nd2.Key\n        <span style=\"color:Blue;\">orderby</span> nd2.Index\n        <span style=\"color:Blue;\">select</span> <span style=\"color:Blue;\">new</span> NutrientDescription\n                    {\n                        Amount = n.AmountPerHundredGrams,\n                        Description = nd.Index.Item2,\n                        UnitOfMeasure = nd.Index.Item1\n                    };\r\n</pre></div><br />To learn more, read the full <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/sterlingdatabase/\">Sterling User&#39;s Guide</a>.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
