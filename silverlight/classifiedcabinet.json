With the power of Silverlight, it lets users zoom and drag the items, categorize them into shelves, filter and see detailed view. It can be used\r\n in wide range of scenarios like product showcasing, bookshelf, etc. The idea for this control grew out of the widely popular\r\n<a href=\"http://www.silverlightshow.net/books.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">SilverlightShow bookshelf</a> which turns out to attract people attention quite a lot. With this component we converted the bookshelf to a more generic control that you can use in your application.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"View Demo\" href=\"http://bookshelf.silverlight.bg/\" target=\"_blank\"><img title=\"Bookshelf\" src=\"http://download.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=classifiedcabinet&DownloadId=211468\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Bookshelf\" width=\"946\" height=\"561\" style=\"padding-left:0px; padding-right:0px; display:inline; padding-top:0px; border-width:0px\"></a>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee a <a title=\"Bookshelf Demo\" href=\"http://bookshelf.silverlight.bg/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\ndemo</a> of how this controls looks like and behaves.</p>\r\n<h2>What's new</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The ClassifiedCabinet project is now available on <a title=\"NuGet\" href=\"http://nuget.org/List/Packages/ClassifiedCabinet\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nNuget</a>!
