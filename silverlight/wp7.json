Much like the desktop API. I will checkin once finished.<br /><br /><b>Releases</b><br />Note: there are no releases yet as this is work in progress and does not have full unit test coverage yet. I have the tests I just need to import them onto the Codeplex source control server. I plan to do this over the comming days.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
