The code of the app is here published for anyone to download and analyze it to learn the basic internals\r\n of a WP7 app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe objective of the game is to guess which tile matches the color described by the hex string on top of the app. The game has 3 difficulty levels: easy (2 tiles), medium (4 tiles and this is the default mode) and hard (9 tiles). The code allows to add more\r\n levels (if needed) with just a few lines of code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Hexing Colors game on WP7 marketplace  by doctor.Fate, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/56448117@N00/5366303278/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5083/5366303278_e29ebe441c.jpg\" alt=\"Hexing Colors game on WP7 marketplace \" width=\"500\" height=\"399\"></a></p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app can be installed from the Windows Phone Marketplace on a Windows Phone 7 device or using the Zune Software on a PC.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
