Unlike the existing <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/wikipage?ProjectName=FlickrNet\">Flickr.Net wrapper</a>, which relies on a lot of custom serialization and request issuing/response processing code, the Flickr API for Silverlight harnesses the built in capabilities of WCF to perform requests. And it is designed specifically for Silverlight.<br /><br /><b>Status</b><br />This project is still in early stages and only has a small number of methods tested. Contributions are welcome!<br /><br /><b>Download</b><br />Currently the project is only available via source code download (see the Source Code tab). Once I get better coverage of the FlickerAPI I will do a beta release.<br /><br /><b>Dependencies</b><br />The Flickr API for Silverlight depends on <a href=\"http://slrest.codeplex.com/\">WCF Rest  Extensions for Silverlight</a>. You&#39;ll need to checkout both repositories to build.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
