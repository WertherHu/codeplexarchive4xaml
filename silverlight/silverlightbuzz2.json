The cube is free to move on any axis (x, y or z) and is setup to move based on the users mouse position on screen, moving faster as the mouse moves further away from the cube.<br /><br /><img src=\"http://www.silverlightbuzz.com/images/codeplex/cubeSpin1.jpg\" /><br /><br /><img src=\"http://www.silverlightbuzz.com/images/codeplex/cubeSpin2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
