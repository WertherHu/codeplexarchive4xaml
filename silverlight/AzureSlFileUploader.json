In his project all layout is done with Silverlight, while I wanted it done in HTML/JavaScript. I also wanted some extra features like being able to cancel uploads etc.<br /><br />This is a community project, let me know if you want to contribute to it.<br /><br />Thank you for visiting this project!<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Inge Henriksen.<br /><br />My blog: <a href=\"http://meronymy.blogspot.com\">http://meronymy.blogspot.com</a><br />Tweet me: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ihenriksen\">http://twitter.com/ihenriksen</a><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
