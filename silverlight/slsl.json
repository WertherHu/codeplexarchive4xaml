It turned out to be pretty easy :-)<br /><br />This project uses Silverlight Streaming simple <a href=\"http://dev.live.com/silverlight/api.aspx\">REST API</a> to perform all operations again your SLS account.<br /><br />Right now the only option you have to administer your Silverlight Streaming account is to use the online (<a href=\"http://dev.live.com/silverlight/adminsite.aspx\">Admin website</a>) which works but it&#39;s a boring and tedious task.<br /><br />Using the Silverlight Streaming Library you could write your own winform client app to manage your SLE account, your own custom toolwindow within Visual Studio (just to feel &quot;at home&quot;), etc. If you write your own client for using this library please let me know! (I don&#39;t want your money, I&#39;m just curious).<br /><br />To start learning about the <b>Silverlight Streaming Library</b> take a look at:\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://slsl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=supported%20features&referringTitle=Home\">supported features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://slsl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=object%20model&referringTitle=Home\">object model</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://slsl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=samples&referringTitle=Home\">samples</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://slsl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ideas&referringTitle=Home\">ideas</a></li></ul>\n<br />Enjoy!</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
