  "Description": "The idea of this project is based on the following project:\r\nhttp://silverlightfileupld.codeplex.com/\r\n\r\nIt uses silverlight 4 and tries to keep a plain interface in order to make it easy to include in your project. It uses the same concept of sending files in small chunks as the previously mentioned project.\r\n\r\nI have added some features and made some modifications including the use of the Image Tools project in order to allow the application to resize images and specify the format in which such images should be saved in the server. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the uploader converts from any allowed image format to .png and resize the images according to the parameters that are passed to the updaloder.\r\n\r\nYou can convert the images to any format supported by Image Tools project, for more information about this project please follow this link:\r\nhttp://imagetools.codeplex.com/",
