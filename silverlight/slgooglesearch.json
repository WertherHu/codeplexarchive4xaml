It is developed in C&#35; and support out-of-browser mode.<br /><br />I tried to experiment with the Google Search API for non-javascript environments. It accepts requests via RESTful interface and returns results via JSON.<br /><br />You have to encode your search request in this way:<br /><a href=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web?v=1.0&amp;q=Silverlight&amp;rsz=large&amp;start=10\">http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web?v=1.0&amp;q=Silverlight&amp;rsz=large&amp;start=10</a><br />It means to search for Silverlight, return 8 results (large result size), start with result at index 10.<br /><br />I built a simple silverlight client, that makes requests to this service by <b>WebClient</b> class , convert the <b>JSON</b> result to an XML and then parse it to a collection of GoogleSearchResult(class) objects shown in ItemsControl.<br /><br />I tested the new WebBrowser control in which, you can preview desired search result. Because it works only in Out of Browser mode I practiced utilization of InstallState and IsRunningOutOfBrowser properties to provide install button and determine whether application runs OoB or not.<br /><br />More information about this project and other useful resources you could find on <b>my blog</b> <br /><a href=\"http://bachelorthesis.zdechovan.com/silverlight-application-google-search/\">http://bachelorthesis.zdechovan.com/silverlight-application-google-search/</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
