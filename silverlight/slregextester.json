This regex checker validates the expression syntax and provides results by leveraging the .Net Framework&#39;s native System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex class allowing developers to see accurate results and pattern error messages in real-time.  It is developed in Silverlight 4&#47;.Net 4.0.<br /><br />This project conforms to the MVVM pattern and also implements\n<ul><li>Custom Behaviors - Used to trigger the regex evaluation .5 seconds after the user stops typing</li>\n<li>Custom Validation Attributes - Used to validate the regex pattern and show and an exception message on the screen</li>\n<li>Custom Validation Message Styles - Used to place a validation error under a Textbox, rather than to the right side</li></ul>\n<br /><b>New in Version 1.1</b><br />A few small features have been added to allow for more ease of use:\n<ul><li>Regex pattern box is now multiline and resizeable</li>\n<li>User can now open and save the regex pattern as *.txt files</li></ul>\n<br />For an example of this tool, visit <a href=\"http://blog.stevekonves.com/2012/01/an-even-better-regex-tester/\">http://blog.stevekonves.com/2012/01/an-even-better-regex-tester/</a>.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
