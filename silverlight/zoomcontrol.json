  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\"><b>ZoomControl for Silverlight 3</b><br /><br />This themed control allows to zoom-in/out and pan the content contained within.<br />However, inertial behavior is not yet supported, but you may add it, if you need it. <br />Also, in light of things like multi touch, i&#39;m thinking of adding gesture support (pinch for zoom control). <br /><br />Make sure to comment in the discussions if you&#39;re missing a feature.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
