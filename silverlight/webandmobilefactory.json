However, we've broadened - rather, changed tactics. We are basically a small start-up, who now specialize in writing apps, both web and mobile, using a variety of tools\r\n and technologies, for a myriad variety of uses. Our aim is to provide world-class web and mobile app engineering services to middle-sized businesses, as well as governmental and non-profit organizations.</p>\r\n<p>We're still working on our &quot;corporate&quot; website - it shouldn't take more than a a week or so. We're also revamping our Codeplex site - this is where we will share our open-source work with you, as well as our experiences while writing code for the web and\r\n mobile platforms. Think of it as our sandbox - a place where you guys give shape to our ideas. The next few days should see a lot of change, so stay tuned!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cheers!</p>\r\n<p>Rudi</p>\r\n<p>CTO, The Web and Mobile Factory.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PS - This might not sound nice, but when I say we're revamping, that also means everything we worked on previously, goes into the recycle bin. Sorry!</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
