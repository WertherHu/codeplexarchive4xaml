The Web Part uses Silverlight 1.0 to display the media content, and provides the typical playback controls that one would expect from a web-based video player. This CodePlex project also includes all of the packaging and deployment code needed to create an installable SharePoint Solution.<br /><br />Media content may be sourced from a Document Library or any URL. The Web Part also provides a Cell Consumer Connection Point that allows the video player to be connected directly  to a list of URLs or a Document Library of media files.<br /><br />Additional information on starting a new project is available here: <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=CodePlex&amp;title=CodePlex%20Project%20Startup%20Guide\">Project Startup Guide</a>.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
