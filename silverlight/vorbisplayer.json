MoonVorbis was wrapped into an easy-to-use Silverlight user control, to play Ogg Vorbis sound files.<br /><br />The VorbisPlayer is what everybody has been looking for. The VorbisPlayer solves the short sound problem, is able to play loop-sets seamless, and can play sound effects with low latency.<br /><br />The source code contains two Silverlight projects. <br /><br />One project contains the VorbisPlayer source code.
