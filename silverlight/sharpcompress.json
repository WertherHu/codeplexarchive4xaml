I hope you're using SharpCompress and finding it useful. Please give me feedback on what you'd like to see changed especially as far as usability goes. New feature suggestions are always welcome as well. I would also like to know what projects\r\n SharpCompress is being used in. I like seeing how it is used to give me ideas for future versions. Thanks!</p>\r\n<h3>Want to contribute?</h3>\r\n<p>I'm always looking for help or ideas. Please submit code or email with ideas. Unfortunately, just letting me know you'd like to help is not enough because I really have no overall plan of what needs to be done.
