  "HomeWiki": "<div class=\"wikidoc\"><b>A Designer and Spatial Visualization tool for Silverlight 3</b><br />Argentum Tela is a design-time environment written entirely in Silverlight 2.  Using this extensible framework, you can build cross platform Visio-esque applications in the browser.  <br />Argentum Tela is a Designer Framework for Silverlight 3.   This framework can be used to create a drag and drop designer experience that should be familiar to users of Visual Studio, Expression Blend, or Visio.  There are many cases where it can be useful to build a document by dragging and dropping controls and editing them on a designer surface.  The framework is roughly based on idioms from the Windows Forms 2 design time experience, breaking from this where it makes sense to do so.<br /><br /><img src=\"/projects/agt/90d6c2a7-2d02-4e73-bdb2-924185b8c6ca\" alt=\"CodeplexSS.jpg\" title=\"CodeplexSS.jpg\" /><br /><br /><br />The current release is of Alpha quality, neither feature complete nor particularly stable.<br /><br />*Implemented features:\n<ul><li>Toolbox</li>\n<li>Drag and drop to surface</li>\n<li>Control selection, moving, and scaling on the surface</li>\n<li>Property editing via a PropertyGrid</li></ul>\n*Future features:\n<ul><li>Serialization/Deserialization of the designer document state</li>\n<li>Pluggability using a &quot;stencil set&quot;</li>\n<li>Undo support, Designer transactions</li>\n<li>Configurable design surface behaviors\n<ul><li>snap lines</li>\n<li>rotate thumbs</li>\n<li>measurement adorners</li></ul></li>\n<li>Full Screen support</li>\n<li>Zoom in/out </li>\n<li>Customizable look and feel</li>\n<li>Drawing/Connector support\n</li></ul><ul><li>Future demo applications\n<ul><li>Slide show creator</li>\n<li>UML diagram</li></ul>\n<br />An IoC container and some Composite UI constructs were created as part of building the overall solution.\n<ul><li>IoC container: ServiceManager.
