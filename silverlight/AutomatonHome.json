I&#39;ve since moved on to modern options for home automation, where a lot less code is required and obviously... ew WPF and SOAP!  Ya, I still have Automaton Home, but not this code base</i><br /><br /><br />Automaton is my pet project which  I&#39;m using as a spring board to learn MVVM patterns for WPF, with SOA using STE and EF4.<br />It&#39;s purpose is Home Automation.  For the moment, I&#39;m using an Insteon PLC from SmartLabs and their software service called SDM to interface with it.  I hope to expand support for additional Controllers and eliminate SDM requirement in the future.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
