If you want to understand the way SLMapViewer works it is strongly suggested you read the <a href=\"http://www.paolocorti.net/2006/10/27/mapflashviewer-framework-asp-net-implementation-c/\">MapFlashViewer ASP.NET implementation</a>  first<br /><br />SLMapviewer is basically a morphing of the MapFlash viewer, focusing squarely on MapServer with some added functionality such as:\n<ul><li>Selection tool</li>\n<li>Select By Attributes dialog</li>\n<li>View current Scale</li>\n<li>Add/remove point</li>\n<li>Legend Control</li>\n<li>Measure tool</li>\n<li>Hyperlink button</li>\n<li>Print</li></ul>\n<br />You can use it as a standalone Map viewer or use it as an embedded map component in your applications as we do at <a href=\"http://www.gaiocorp.com\">Gaiocorp</a>. <br /><br />You can see a running demo of SLMapviewer as a standalone application <a href=\"http://www.mapoholic.com/slmapview/\">here</a> or as embedded in a Fault Reporting System <a href=\"http://www.mapoholic.com/ciprem3\">here</a> </div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
