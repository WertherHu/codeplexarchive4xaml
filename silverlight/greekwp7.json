Things considering to develop<br /><br />- Currently it supports only portrait mode. Landscape would nice to have<br />- Windows Phone 7 currently supports Unicode, so one cannot send SMS with 160 characters. Looking for a fix.<br />- It would be nice to display a preview of the key currently being pressed, such as in the regular Windows Phone 7 keyboard.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
