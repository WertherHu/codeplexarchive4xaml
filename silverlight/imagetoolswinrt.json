As we known, .Net image tools provide much more image functionality, and it's really powerfull for us, including the .gif image's animation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But one thing is that the .Net imagetools just supports windows phone 7.x and <span>\r\nSilverlight</span>, so I got the idea to port the full-set fucntions of this project to windows store application, and it costs me overall two days, but obviously, it's worthful.</p>\r\n<p>ImageTools for WinRT is a porting library from ImageTools for Silverlight, which provides additional functionality for loading, saving and manipulation images from different sources and with different formats.
