The goal of ExEn is to make it as easy as possible for you to port your game with the absolute minimum of platform-specific code. ExEn has been written with performance,\r\n robustness and API accuracy in mind.</p>\r\n<p>On&nbsp;<strong>Silverlight</strong>, ExEn maps XNA's immediate-style API onto Silverlight's retained-style object tree in a high-performance way that does not require you to do any scene management. ExEn on Silverlight makes full use of Silverlight's hardware\r\n acceleration.</p>\r\n<p>On&nbsp;<strong>iOS</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Android</strong>, ExEn translates the XNA API into the platform's own API (and OpenGL for graphics) using Xamarin's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ios.xamarin.com/\">MonoTouch</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://android.xamarin.com/\">Mono\r\n for Android</a>&nbsp;products to provide an implementation of C#/.NET and platform API bindings for each platform.</p>\r\n<p>ExEn currently only supports XNA's 2D APIs for graphics (ie: SpriteBatch). However it is still possible to access the underlying platform using ExEn. For example, to port a 3D game to iOS and Android, you could port your renderer to OpenGL, and use ExEn\r\n for everything else.</p>\r\n</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
