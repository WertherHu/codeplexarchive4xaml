The idea is to simplify the management of two separate .csproj files pointing to same code base and soft linking between them.<br /><b>Please note that this project is not longer maintained since Microsoft solved this issue with Portable Libraries. If you have any questions feel free to reach me at mehtarjt@gmail.com</b><br /><br />This version of BuildAsSilverlight  is tested with the following environment only:<br />.NET Runtime 4.0<br />Visual Studio 2010 Professional<br />Silverlight 4<br /><br /><b>Usage</b><br /><br />Open any .NET Class library project. Right Click and click BuildAsSilverlight4 as shown below:<br /><img src=\"/projects/buildassilverlight/b36ae94d-a439-40e5-9795-f3052fa64835\" alt=\"howto.jpg\" title=\"howto.jpg\" /><br /><br />Assembly will be build using the same Assembly name defined in the project with &quot;.SL&quot; appended in the end. Binaries are directly published in Release folder under bin and output window can be used to see the details of the same. Screenshot below:<br /><img src=\"/projects/buildassilverlight/feee7b00-6bad-420b-93a4-cd67018689ee\" alt=\"outputwindow.jpg\" title=\"outputwindow.jpg\" /><br /><br /><b>Limitations</b>\n<ol><li>No defined way to provide custom name to the built asssembly.</li>\n<li>Presently works only against .NET 4.0 MSBuild and no way to customize build process.</li>\n<li>Builds only the release configuration as of now.</li></ol>\n<br /><b>Feedback/Suggestions</b><br />I m looking for more ideas/feedbacks/suggestion on how this tool can be made more useful.
