The project started as a way to create generic and reusable components that help WPF projects get started quickly.<br /><br />Included with the source code is a sample application that is meant to show some of the features included in the library and provide examples to get you started on creating your own applications. <br /><br /><b>New Release : Dec 27, 2010</b><br />A new release of MVVMKit is available for download. It contains a more refined version of the framework with simplified architecture, re-designed classes for consistency, new examples added to the demo application and API documentation built with Sandcastle.</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
