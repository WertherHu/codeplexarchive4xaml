All the changes to the canvas are being tracked, displayed in the list view through MVVM binding and can be undone/redone.<br /><br />The original source code of the framework was based on that in <a href=\"https://physioassist.codeplex.com/\">Physio Assist</a> a WPF application with very little change. And it can clearly be seen that with even less effort this source code can be ported back to WPF.<br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
