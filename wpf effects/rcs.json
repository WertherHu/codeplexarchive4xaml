Allows to turn off &#47; on lights, sound effect, retracts chassis, using free servo channel. <br /><br />Following project contains AVR Studio solution, pcb and schema files (Eagle) for remote controlled swich. I&#39;m using that switch for enable / disable LED light on wings of my flying model. This project is closed . There is no future development plans.<br /><br />To make it work you need, AVR Tiny 25 uC, two transistors, some AVR programmer and AVR Studio 5 or higher. <br /><br />RC Switch can be plugged into any receiver servo channel. It recognizes minimum and maximum position of radio stick. <br /><br />This video presents working module:<br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSmowMdxt6s\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSmowMdxt6s</a><br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
