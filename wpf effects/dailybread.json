Use that until I manage to finish the new and improved version. If you have an internet connection, it should give you a message when I have the new one ready. You can find it here under Releases.<br /><br />I really have no clue when the new one will be ready. I currently have a struggle with making various ends meet (timewise that is) and yeah... hopefully one day I will find the time to plow into this and finish it =)<br /><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
