It allows to inject performance traces into any NET software, get them back for analyse and reporting. Reflection Studio is a complete new re-write of my unfinished/deleted project NPerf.<br />\n<h2>Background</h2>\rOn my last project, I experienced that there was no software to test performance on mobiles for NET applications. The ones working on Winform or ASP.NET site have a high performance cost because they hook everything they need. So, I start this one having with a view to including in it all my work around reflection like assembly diagrams and code generation.<br />\n<h2>Work in progress, Talented contributors wanted !</h2>\rIf you feel interrested, please let me know at guillaume DOT waser AT free DOT fr<br />\n<h2>Quick overview</h2>\r<ul><li>Performance injection module</li>\n<li>Assembly explorer and class diagram</li>\n<li>Database explorer, schema plugin and query editor, automatique scripting, Quality audit, Diagrams(?)</li>\n<li>Template explorer, code editor, code generation (later)</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Main screen</h2>\r<img src=\"/projects/ReflectionStudio/6257509b-dfee-4da7-be20-57d1690de6e4\" alt=\"main.png\" title=\"main.png\" /><br /><br />\n<h2>Publications</h2>\r<a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/ReflectionStudio_Part1.aspx\">Introduction: Architecture and Design</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/ReflectionStudio_Part2.aspx\">User interface: Themes, dialogs, controls, external libraries</a> <br /><a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/ReflectionStudio_Part4.aspx\">Database: Schema, Provider and Plugin, Controls</a> <br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
