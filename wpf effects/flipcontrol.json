All of that is in a 3D context! <br /><br />The Project Page is at: <a href=\"http://www.meirhuber.de/Projects/wpf/flip/Default.aspx\">http://www.meirhuber.de/Projects/wpf/flip/Default.aspx</a><br /><br />if you are interested in contributing feel free to contact me!<br /><br />- Mario</div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
