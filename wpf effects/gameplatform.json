There are over 10,000 line code in the project, widely use WPF, WCF and LINQ techniques, oriented to interface programming base on AddIn design.<br /><br />I develop this open source project from Nov 06 to now, from Winform to WPF. During this 3 years, there are over 13,000 people download Winform version and over 7,000 people download WPF version from my blog.<br /><br />I donot publish Winform version because it is so old, I even use GDI+ to draw the card during playing, and write TCP socket communication by myself.<br /><br />Now I update it to a version with WPF, WCF. But I still lack 2 key techniques, one is UDP communication in WCF, and NAT implementation to prevent firewall, the other one is adding more and more games as AddIns, which can be intergrated into the game platform if it implements the game interface.<br /><br />Some pictures from the GamePlatform as follows:<br /><br />1.After login:<br /><img src=\"http://images.cnblogs.com/cnblogs_com/Jax/WindowsLiveWriter/GameHall2.0a_2884/image_thumb.png\" /><br /><br />2.Enter into one hall:<br /><img src=\"http://images.cnblogs.com/cnblogs_com/Jax/WindowsLiveWriter/GameHall2.0a_2884/image_thumb_3.png\" /><br /><br />3.Enlarge one desk in the hall:<br /><img src=\"http://images.cnblogs.com/cnblogs_com/Jax/WindowsLiveWriter/GameHall2.0a_2884/a_thumb.png\" /><br /><br />4.Server and Monitor<br /><img src=\"http://images.cnblogs.com/cnblogs_com/Jax/WindowsLiveWriter/GameHall2.0a_2884/image_thumb_4.png\" /><br /><br />I have a dream, to make it as famous as PetShop, being a standard model in this domain.
