The idea is to bring features that popular IDEs provide to HLSL coding, as well as features that are specific to graphical coding.<br /><br /><b>Current Features</b>\n<ul><li>Syntax Highlighting.</li>\n<li>Folding code blocks and multiple line comments.</li>\n<li>Sampler state configuration page.</li>\n<li>Live preview of effect output.</li>\n<li>Errors and warnings list, double-click to be taken to the start of the error.</li>\n<li>(Optional) Line numbering.</li>\n<li>(Optional) Word wrap.</li>\n<li>Dockable interface.</li></ul>\n<br /><b>Warning</b><br />This project is still very young, and as such has a lot of bugs which may or may not crash the program. While I am working to resolve said bugs, WPF is still new to me (first time I&#39;ve used it), so bug fixes may be slow coming as I learn the WPF API. If you have any advice on resolving bugs you encounter feel free to post a discussion about it, relevant educational links are welcome. <u>Save your work often!</u><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-q1qQeLKQQ\">Early demonstration video</a></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
