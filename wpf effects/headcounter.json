It is ideally suited to a Loot Council approach to looting.\n<h2>Screenshots</h2>\r\n<img src=\"http://www.mathematicallysafe.com/headcounter/headcounter-1.png\" /><br /><img src=\"http://www.mathematicallysafe.com/headcounter/headcounter-2.png\" /><br /><img src=\"http://www.mathematicallysafe.com/headcounter/headcounter-3.png\" /><br /><img src=\"http://www.mathematicallysafe.com/headcounter/headcounter-4.png\" /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
