The last ones, however, must be parametrized specifically for each customer and publishing environment.<br /><br />Therefore nobody likes the manual parametrization, boring and likely to errors, of configuration files, especially if repetitive (see stage and production environment of customers that need to be updated with predetermined time intervals). Right?<br /><br />Here <b>NetConfigurator</b> enters the scene with its philosophy: <i>“parametrize one and configure N times”!</i><br /><br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
