I did leave the <b>browser</b> out, since I didn&#39;t really needed it for my purposes. <br /><br />I hope this helps some of you understand the deeper workings of Silverlight. I can only advice breaking down functionality as much as possible. Rather create more objects with specific behaviors than building it all into one massive chunk of code. <br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />--tolga<br /></div><div class=\"ClearBoth\"></div>",
